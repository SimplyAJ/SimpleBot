[03:25] <@omegazeron> I miiiiight know the issue? But I dunno why it would've stopped it from responding

[03:33] <@battlebuddiesgaming> I should do
[03:34] <@omegazeron> I sincerely hope this isn't because of the uptime shit Night did
[03:34] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Hm?
[03:34] <@elygem> restarting phone aj
[03:34] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Okay
[03:35] <@omegazeron> I'm using Nightdev's API for uptime, and recently he made it so it posts a long post about how "looks like you're using Nightdev's API and maybe you should leave that to Nightbot"
[03:35] <@omegazeron> And I'm using the uptime API to set whether it's 1 or 2 point gain
[03:35] <@omegazeron> Gimme a sec and I'll try to fix it
[03:35] <@omegazeron> Or figure out if that's even the problem
[03:35] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Okay
[03:42] <@omegazeron> OK, lines 267-274, replace those with the updated lines in the pastebin
[03:42] <@omegazeron> Sent it again in Discord
[03:42] <@omegazeron> In the pastebin, it goes to 276 though
[03:43] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Okay so
[03:43] <@omegazeron> Replace in mIRC lines 267-274 with lines 267-276 from the pastebin
[03:43] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Ohhh shit okay one sec

[03:45] <@omegazeron> But yeah, this is what it used to say every time I used uptime
[03:45] <@omegazeron> Oh hey, you're using an API meant for Nightbot, not for whatever you're using. Maybe you'd want to try out the new Nightbot beta: https://beta.nightbot.tv

[14:07] <hotsammysliz> it is completely ridiculous how the passport process is in us
[14:07] <escheria> there is no embassy I could go to here in Switzerland

[14:08] <hytamo> is it just me or do you go on mario maker hiatus for weeks at a time?
[14:08] <escheria> either get a visa on my old pass and go to the US embassy, but have an old pass
[14:08] <hotsammysliz> WHAT COULD TAKE 3 WEEKS.
[14:08] <escheria> or i could get a completely new passport, need no visa... but fly to another country to get a new passport
[14:09] <escheria> I combined my document renewal with my family visit
[14:09] <hytamo> I end up unfollowing the channel because I'll see it pop up with a completely different person playing a completely different game for a few weeks

[12:46] <dadsprivatetime> Goht was literally perfect, but now its constantly 'switch out of goron mask, be link, shoot arrows'
[12:47] <dadsprivatetime> That is if you land on his back, which is SO satisfying to do, but then they punish you for it
03[12:47] * chubblomeli (chubblomeli@chubblomeli.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #battlebuddiesgaming
[12:48] <dadsprivatetime> Like, it's weird because Odolwa was made kind of less threatening.
[12:49] <dadsprivatetime> He lost his fire circle, which I really liked. Same with how you could just sword fight him with Link and it was more of a reinforcement of OoT's mechanics in a boss fight with only swords.
[12:49] <chubblomeli> o7
[12:49] <dadsprivatetime> However, I do like the Gyorg change and I thought Twinmold's incorporation of both ways to beat him from the original
[12:50] <dadsprivatetime> Although, Twinmold part 2 took a few too many hits for my liking
[12:51] <@jaystank> that was a surprisingly strong stage OMGScoots

[16:51] <mirby> also new stage submitted AJ :D
[16:52] <drakorious> throw in some high jumping fireballs for more suspense?
[16:53] <dadsprivatetime> put a spiny in between
[16:53] <dadsprivatetime> underneath the skewer
[16:54] <drakorious> since you were so kind at the start of the 2nd half, add a courtesy reset door at the bottom?
[16:54] <dadsprivatetime> that way its an easier jump but has dangerous to linget

[18:51] <inah8bit> and changes to the swim speed made one of the most important glitches to be unusable.

[22:53] <drbotch> too much talking
[22:53] <drbotch> a lot of them are the same ones who love undertale and say its the best rpg
[22:53] <oblivionx7> mini-boss time
[22:53] <waluigiiii> tru
[22:54] <waluigiiii> it excalebar
[22:54] <electrokinetica> undertale is hardly the BEST rpg, but certainly one of the most inventive
[22:54] <waluigiiii> ITS INUYASHA
[22:54] <oblivionx7> excalebar?? is that a new sword

[22:55] <oblivionx7> ^
[22:55] <waluigiiii> whats an anime???
[22:55] <thekckomplex> id like ff7 if it wasnt turn based. i have a hard time getting into turn based rpgs
[22:55] <oblivionx7> #animelivesmatter botch
[22:55] <drbotch> ugh kc
[22:55] <drbotch> that hurts

[22:55] <waluigiiii> boku no pico
[22:55] <drbotch> noooo anime is great noo

[22:56] <electrokinetica> Turn based is fine! Bravely Default does it quite well
[22:57] <thekckomplex> turnbased is great. just not for me.
[22:58] <drbotch> some of the best rpgs are turn based

[23:28] <drbotch> it better not be open world
[23:28] <drbotch> every adventure game needs to have that metroidvania style to it
[23:29] <thekckomplex> thats what it is supposed to be, botch
[23:29] <drbotch> thats why i love darksiders
[23:29] <thekckomplex> open world as fuck zelda
[23:29] <drbotch> yeah i know its gonna be like that
[23:29] <drbotch> thats dumb
[23:29] <thekckomplex> weird concept
[23:29] <waluigiiii> thays why i love animal crossing
[23:29] <drbotch> everything has to be fucking open world now i hate it
[23:29] <electrokinetica> LBWwas good. That's a proper twist
[23:29] <drbotch> the trend needs to die
[23:29] <drbotch> darksiders was amazing
[23:29] <waluigiiii> a lot of things need to die
[23:29] <drbotch> mainly because i love that artist
[23:29] <thekckomplex> every game drifting to the open world shit is obnoxious
[23:30] <drbotch> and the voice acting
[23:30] <drbotch> and i love the combat

[23:30] <@samurai71> the ghost of Lamby is here
[23:31] <@lambyep> What where?
[23:31] <drbotch> thats why i didnt really care for metal gear 5
[23:31] <waluigiiii> look
[23:31] <drbotch> i didnt like the mission structure
[23:31] <waluigiiii> its the eleventh docter
[23:31] <waluigiiii> doctor
[23:31] <drbotch> it felt super repetitive and i still beat it but man it just got on my nerves
[23:31] <electrokinetica> Nintendo can pull their own take on a common genre. Look at the "shooter" they made.
[23:32] <electrokinetica> What would their "open world" look like?
[23:32] <ashketchym27> Hate that mailman..

[23:48] <drbotch> lionhead was doomed the second they announced a fucking bs fable mp game

[23:50] <ashketchym27> whats wrong with steam console? like i brought multiple of games on my steam account and i know its very expensive.
[23:50] <thekckomplex> because they are fucked. much better to build your on pc

[23:52] <ashketchym27> yeah its way much better on PC. But the problem is the space storages.

[01:07] <drbotch> cake farts is worse
[01:07] <vanillagumi> Boku no Pico is considered CP in some countries

[01:08] <vanillagumi> HYAHHYUH HYAAAAH
[01:09] <waluigiiii> cloppimg
[01:09] <waluigiiii> im clopsexual
[01:09] <@hxh_leorio> this is the timeline that child link from oot fails I think
[01:09] <vanillagumi> OoT failure was windwaker
[01:09] <vanillagumi> I thought
[01:10] <@gamedragonx> that moment when AJ learns what caking means
[01:10] <@elygem> "thats a black thing" OpieOP
[01:10] <thekckomplex> good ol timeliens OpieOP
[01:10] <@gamedragonx> for moments like this
[01:10] <notbutterfree_bird> There are lots of timelines where Link fails.
[01:10] <oblivionx7> no leorio this is when became a kid again the failing one is a link to the past timeline
[01:10] <@gamedragonx> some people wait a lifetime
[01:10] <thekckomplex> timelines*
[01:11] <drbotch> but its me :D

[01:12] <drbotch> LOL
[01:12] <@gamedragonx> that's actually kinda sad
[01:12] <drbotch> i care im just really passionate about that link
[01:12] <@gamedragonx> but hype at the same time
[01:12] <drbotch> i love lore shit like that
[01:12] <thekckomplex> i had forgotten how sad the child link shit was.
[01:12] <vanillagumi> Im trying to clean my keyboard, and not hit enter by accident and spam chat with a ton of random letters
03[01:12] * paperjoshi (paperjoshi@paperjoshi.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #battlebuddiesgaming
[01:12] <waluigiiii> emo link
[01:12] <@gamedragonx> so what's the other scenario? that young link doesn't warn Zelda about Ganon?
[01:12] <oblivionx7> twilight princess is child timeline,wind waker is adult timeline,and a link to the past is the failling timeline
[01:12] <@gamedragonx> and Wind Waker happens?
[01:13] <nikroaj> did she just .....go in his ass O.o ?
[01:13] <vanillagumi> I cant do that starfox
[01:13] <@elygem> o.o
[01:13] <@ninsunu> unplug keyboard
[01:13] <paperjoshi> WInd Waker is the end of Ocarina, you defeat Ganon, and Zelda sends you back to the past.
[01:13] <@elygem> idek whats going on anymore
[01:13] <@elygem> yet again
[01:13] <waluigiiii> just dont clean
[01:13] <nikroaj> i never did Ely razK
[01:13] <paperjoshi> So now there's a ruined future with a trapped Ganon and no Link
[01:13] <oblivionx7> wind waker is when link returns to the past after beating ganon but in the future when ganon return their no hero so the goddness flood hyrule
[01:13] <vanillagumi> let me just remove the bottom half of my laptop
[01:14] <nikroaj> when you went from wolf form to normal form
[01:14] <@gamedragonx> oh so Ocarina is the future Hyrule that Young link saved
[01:14] <paperjoshi> So when Ganon inevitably escapes, oops! No Link to save everyone. So the gods flood the world instead.
[01:14] <@gamedragonx> and when he dipped, Link never reappeared
[01:14] <@ninsunu> ahh, thought you were on a tower
[01:14] <vanillagumi> how do I watch this without turning it off

[01:14] <thekckomplex> what was the link to the past timeline?
[01:14] <@elygem> mobile master race OpieOP
[01:14] <thekckomplex> i cant recall
[01:14] <oblivionx7> yep that the adult timeline where wind waker takes place
[01:14] <@samurai71> is the video about boku no pico just the guy going "yoooooooooooooo" and "this chcik has a dick" or something?
[01:15] <@gamedragonx> so that means TP and WW are the latest Links?
[01:15] <@samurai71> cause i think i found it
[01:15] <paperjoshi> Link to the Past is when you game over in OoT and Link dies.
[01:15] <drbotch> zeldas got mad skills

[01:15] <@elygem> it feels like hes going so fucking slow
[01:15] <@gamedragonx> so LttP = OOT when link dies, and Hyrule isn't even saved in the first place?
[01:15] <@elygem> why do you feel so slow
[01:16] <paperjoshi> this is straight up Sonic 3 Ice Cap Zone guys jeez
[01:16] <vanillagumi> them pro strats, swing wildly :D
[01:16] <drbotch> just look up the timeline
[01:16] <waluigiiii> is this the trailer for Everest

[01:16] <drbotch> its honestly easier to look at the chart imo
[01:17] <paperjoshi> Hyrule is saved in the Fallen Timeline, but not by Link. Zelda and the other sages do stuff to seal Ganon in the Sacred Realm, which becomes the Dark World of LttP
[01:17] <@gamedragonx> Hyrule Historia? nah, Damon gave it to Seth
[01:17] <@gamedragonx> so its at least in Orlando now
[01:17] <thekckomplex> half of twilight princess ost is garbage and half is good

[01:50] <mirby> the interesting thing is that there's a crossover between the Boktai games and the last 3 Battle Network games (4 and 5 in the US since the third Boktai never came here so they literally removed the chips and gameplay scenario from Battle Network 6 when they localized it)
[01:50] <@elygem> LOL
[01:50] <mirby> the GunDelSol chip is OP in 4 and 5 anyways so yeah

[01:51] <@elygem> whats your idea
[01:51] <oblivionx7> oh i remember the GunDelSol chip it was my favorite one in in 4 and 5

[01:52] <mirby> actually no, AJ, if you hack in the Boktai chips in Battle Network 6 and try using them the game crashes
[01:52] <mirby> so in the eShop version you only get opposite-version Navi chips
[01:53] <@elygem> LOL
[01:53] <oblivionx7> never knew where it came from but nice tidbits
[01:53] <@elygem> sure
[01:53] <mirby> boktai 2 has an awesome post-game scenario that involves ShadeMan and has some great Battle Network remixes in the Boktai style
[01:53] <mirby> plus at the end you get to see MegaMan in the Boktai sprite style so that's cool
[01:54] <mirby> and that scenario makes slightly more sense than Django randomly appearing on the Internet in Lan's world cause, you know, Django's a human and not a digital entity
[01:55] <mirby> TRIPLE DELETE
[01:55] <mirby> wait wrong game
[01:55] <oblivionx7> Mirby did these games come to the states never heard of it
[01:55] <mirby> Boktai 1 and 2 did, Boktai 3 didn't
[01:56] <oblivionx7> hmm im have to check them out then
[01:56] <mirby> which is a shame cause Boktai 3 (or Shin Bokura no Taiyou: Gyakushuu no Sabata if you're so inclined) has the best soundtrack
[01:56] <@elygem> she doesnt even have an ass
[01:56] <@elygem> she has a sweater on with no sleeves
[01:57] <@elygem> how is she even getting out the doors!
[01:57] <mirby> Battle Network 4 has a good final dungeon theme and sets up the DublSoul system for 5 quite nicely... but yeah aside from that it's ass

[01:57] <mirby> it's a really bad game
[01:58] <mirby> thankfully 5 is much better
[01:59] <mirby> and 6, in my opinion, is even better than 5 (especially since the Cross system is miles above the Soul system)

[03:13] <inah8bit> NO. okay you can have half ;w;
[03:13] <inah8bit> so AJ, my first attemp at running this game my time was 7 hours in 25 minutes. Kappa
[03:14] <inah8bit> the world record is 4 hours, I think im getting there.
[03:15] <inah8bit> it's really fun, breaking your game and having to restart the whole run.. BibleThump im joking it's not
[03:15] <@omegazeron> Do you want me to tell you or no AJ? About the bridge
[03:15] <inah8bit> Yeah, the HD one is 4 Hours actually. the Gamecube one is an hour faster. I believe.
[03:16] <@omegazeron> It's in Gerudo Desert, where the Cave of 100 Trials is
[03:16] <inah8bit> lot of the glitches has been fixed, no quick way to master sword, changes to swimming made it so that the Gorge drop trick isn't usable anymore. cant swim fast enough to get to the loading screen.
[03:17] <mirby> man i want to replay this but i also want to play the HD version when i do replay it but i can't afford the HD version and BibleThump

[04:20] <mirby> as i saw someone say once, it's called the LEGEND of zelda because the incongruities are because they're being retold from a slightly different point of view
[04:21] <mirby> so details change among tellers
[04:21] <justdaid> they admit in the historia, if I remember correctly, they admit it was never really supposed to one story line, but fans whined or something
[04:22] <mirby> but i do feel like the City in the Sky in this game is kinda Skyloft, especially because you get the Double Clawshot in the City in the Sky here and that returns in Skyward Sword so SS Link could've left them there
[04:22] <mirby> i don't think anything like that was in the historia, Daid
[04:23] <lordsquidy13> Winner Winner cuccoo dinner! Kreygasm
[04:23] <justdaid> its in my sons room and he is asleep, i would have to read it again
[04:24] <mirby> i actually like how they did the timeline myself lol
[04:24] <justdaid> yeah, they made good use of what they had
[04:24] <justdaid> and its interestingly woven
[04:24] <mirby> i really want a new game post-Zelda 2 or post-Spirit Tracks
[04:25] <justdaid> at the end of the series?
[04:25] <mirby> especially post-Spirit Tracks in New Hyrule because I like that timeline since Ganon is unequivocally dead in that timeline
[04:25] <oblivionx7> yes please post spirit tracks i love that game to death
[04:25] <mirby> you are now more awesome for loving ST
[04:26] <justdaid> the two after Wind Waker are the only two I have not played
[04:26] <mirby> because skull kid's a little shit
[04:26] <justdaid> well and Skyward
[04:26] <mirby> zelda/tetra: I'll found my own hyrule, with demons and train tracks!
[04:26] <oblivionx7> Daid you should spirit tracks is great
[04:27] <justdaid> are both of those DS titles?
[04:27] <mirby> yes
[04:27] <stephic> do it
[04:27] <oblivionx7> i love how zelda acts in spirit tracks my favorite Zelda overall
[04:27] <mirby> and i hate EU because Europe has both on their Wii U VC
03[04:27] * lordsquidy13 (lordsquidy13@lordsquidy13.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #battlebuddiesgaming
[04:28] <justdaid> the EU gets so little
[04:28] <mirby> i like how everyone from WW/PH is dead but Niko is inexplically still alive and superold in Spirit Tracks
[04:28] <oblivionx7> ^^
[04:28] <mirby> actually Europe has been getting a shitton of games on their Virtual Console
[04:28] <mirby> compared to us who have been getting nothing
[04:28] <@elygem> i almost beat phantom, but then i got to the end and never touched it again
[04:28] <justdaid> its always the ones you dont expect to get out that do
[04:28] <@elygem> yup, that was one of the many games i dont touch
[04:29] <justdaid> have you ever seen the move "The Cube"
[04:29] <nikroaj> im in who ?
[04:29] <mirby> their DS VC library is fantastic compared to ours
[04:29] <mirby> i said superold, didn't I AJ?
[04:29] <oblivionx7> spirit tracks needs more love it a good game people just don't give it much attention
[04:29] <maddrequiem> Briggs Nikro your in Briggs mwhahaha :P
[04:29] <@elygem> nikro youre in everything
[04:29] <justdaid> Zelda and Final Fantasy are two marathons I want to do on my channel
[04:29] <mirby> it has the only instrument you play with your own breath
[04:30] <torokard> Yeah controlwise those games were atrocities
[04:30] <nikroaj> nommLewd am i ?
[04:30] <mirby> AJ people have fixed that issue with button-control patches lol
[04:30] <torokard> I stopped spirit tracks midway through because my left bumper didnt work correctly anymore
[04:30] <mirby> yeah DSs have an issue with L dying
[04:30] <torokard> which meant I couldnt use items very well anymore
[04:30] <mirby> the L button on my DS has been near-death for YEARS
[04:30] <nikroaj> well Ely isnt totally wrong
[04:30] <mirby> yep, for both Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks
[04:31] <mirby> well if you play on PC or have an, uh, flashcard :P
[04:31] <mirby> there's probably a way to get the patched copy onto a cart lol
[04:32] <justdaid> I thought you could just follow the music?
[04:33] <oblivionx7> honestly i have no complaints about the controls lol i usually don't complain much for games
[04:33] <@elygem> LOL
[04:34] <mirby> AJ is lost in these woods, how about that

[04:38] <oblivionx7> if i ever stream first thing im doing is zelda marathon :)
[04:38] <@omegazeron> I used it against Twinrova my first run
[04:39] <mirby> who needs the master sword when you can murder things with a giant two-handed sword of pure death
[04:39] <mirby> should've named it Duff :P
[04:39] <@elygem> but i love the name rilee :(
[04:39] <mirby> i named it Ethan after Ethan Rex and made him become a musician who plays Zelda's theme
[04:39] <mirby> because that is an amazing tune holy shit

[04:41] <mirby> Ages is more story-driven, Seasons is more combat-driven
[04:41] <oblivionx7> ages was more for Oot and Link Awakening while season is more of LoZ and Link to the Past
[04:41] <torokard> I never actually played the oracle games, shame on me. I only played Awakening

[04:42] <mirby> common theory is Oracle of Secrets due to Farore being the third Oracle and that being her title, and her relic probably being the book of secrets
[04:43] <dikitty> how's the game treating you?
[04:43] <oblivionx7> ^^ yep that right
[04:43] <@elygem> i wish i knew about stuff..
[04:43] <@elygem> im useless
[04:43] <@omegazeron> I wonder how they would've done Farore though. She was in both games as the Oracle of Secrets, so what would they do with her and Din/Nayru?
[04:43] <dikitty> I have never finished a legend of zelda game

[04:45] <dikitty> oh nooo that sucks
[04:45] <mirby> they couldn't find what game the bugs were originating from with the password system and Miyamoto upon hearing about it said to make only two games
[04:45] <oblivionx7> by my knowledge the third game was going to based of Adventure of Link and Majora Mask
[04:46] <@nightbot> Hey guys, wanna help the stream grow? Consider tweeting it out here: http://ctt.ec/p0URe
[04:46] <mirby> what bugs me the most is the oracle games were made by Capcom and then they do three versions with no issues with the first Star Force game lol
[04:46] <mirby> but then again, that's comparing tech from GBC with tech from DS
[04:46] <@omegazeron> Well Mirby, those are on DS
[04:46] <@omegazeron> Lmao
[04:46] <mirby> THEY FIGURED IT OUT EVENTUALLY
[04:46] <dikitty> They were crying because I've never finished a zelda game

[04:46] <dikitty> I very rarely finish games

[04:47] <oblivionx7> ^
[04:47] <mirby> except the cd-i games which don't count
[04:47] <mirby> or HD remasters (close on WWHD, don't have TPHD lol)

[04:47] <oblivionx7> NEVER AGAIN!!!
[04:47] <mirby> i have no way to reliably run the CD-i games
[04:47] <dikitty> Wait, does Okami count as a zelda game because I beat that :V
[04:47] <mirby> almost lol
[04:47] <mirby> great game
[04:47] <mirby> never beat the original though, i have beaten Okamiden though!

[04:54] <dikitty> the former. Lah-piss

[04:54] <dikitty> which literally means "stone of lazuli" if I remember rightly
[04:54] <@omegazeron> AJ why don't you just pay the 1 Rupee to not have him attack you?
[04:55] <dikitty> We thought it was a pretty name for a girl
[04:55] <dikitty> and my husband's grand dad was into lapidary so it's kind of an homage to him
[04:55] <dikitty> (Sage's middle name is Ryan's grandpa's first name, Rex)
[04:55] <@elygem> daww
[04:55] <@elygem> i like that
[04:56] <dikitty> Ryan and his grandpa were pretty close
[04:56] <@omegazeron> Assuming you didn't pay the Rupees to get him to stop attacking, he always calls you a cheapskate for paying less than the full price, but nothing bad happens
[04:56] <dikitty> uhm, where you play with stones. lol
[04:56] <dikitty> You collect/work with stones
[04:56] <@omegazeron> Whereas he'll be grateful for the tip if you pay more than full price
[04:57] <@omegazeron> Every 10 iirc
[04:57] <dikitty> speaking of collecting, I might go boot up stardew valley for a day or two of play
[04:59] <mirby> if i had the skills i would make AJ a custom wolf link amiibo and replace wolf link with midna and midna with AJ
[04:59] <mirby> which sounds confusing

[06:24] <serp_it> Yes
[06:24] <serp_it> It was a pain =P
[06:25] <serp_it> Nnnnot really, if you want me to be honest
[06:25] <serp_it> Not my kind of level

[06:26] <serp_it> If you want actual criticism, what mainly put me off was the fact that you had to slog through quite a bit of tedious stuff to get to the challenging parts
[06:26] <serp_it> waiting for the p-switch at the hammer bros to wear off, then the 20 sec ride on the big spiney
[06:26] <@omegazeron> That reminds me, AJ, whatever happened to digital street fights Kappa
[06:26] <serp_it> if the check point ahd been placed after that, I would have ahd a much better time with it
[06:27] <serp_it> Why do I keep typing ahd
[06:28] <serp_it> Yeah, but the second half is way longer and harder
[06:28] <serp_it> and the "boss" is really not a problem compared to what comes afterwards ^^

[06:29] <smeeoffree> Never been my favorite Zelda game I've always been a big old school Zelda kind of guy but I enjoyed the wii controls for this game made it a bit more fun to swing your sword than hit a Button
[06:30] <serp_it> Yeah, I totally understand the theory behind it
[06:30] <serp_it> In practice, I spent 3 minutes on the first half and 50 on the second =P

[06:35] <smeeoffree> I haven't played skyward sword yet I keep hearing mixed reviews about it
[06:36] <@omegazeron> smeeoffree, 95% of negative reviews for SS are because of people getting whiny because they don't like motion controls
[06:36] <@omegazeron> Even though they were amazing
[06:38] <@omegazeron> I love SS's music Kreygasm
[06:38] <@omegazeron> The games come with the soundtrack CD, so you get the dank music for free Kreygasm
[06:38] <smeeoffree> Motion controls are the best idea Nintendo had putting into a system made it easier to put yourself into the game
[06:39] <smeeoffree> I usually go with link to the past for my favorite

[07:48] <@omegazeron> I just fished to get the bottle and that's it
[07:49] <@omegazeron> In the fishing hole, on the left side, the secluded area
[07:49] <@omegazeron> That's in this game right OneHand
[07:49] <inah8bit> im playing pokiman
[07:50] <@omegazeron> Upper Zora River apparently AJ
[07:50] <inah8bit> ORAS.
[07:50] <inah8bit> Just mostly breeding, getting Yellow soon, so I can pokebank all I need to get into competitive for Sun & Moon.
[07:51] <inah8bit> it's $5 a year, probably just some money to keep servers up, i'd say it's worth it if you play a lot of pokemon
[07:51] <@omegazeron> Yeah, it's just to keep servers up
[07:51] <inah8bit> not to mention, there's no way im leaving all my event pokemon from X & Y. OpieOP
[07:52] <@omegazeron> ^ lol
[07:52] <@omegazeron> Same
[07:53] <inah8bit> I hope they put the good things in X/Y and ORAS into Sun & Moon.
[07:53] <@omegazeron> You need Bank to transfer though
[07:53] <inah8bit> like character customization.
[07:54] <inah8bit> I think they'll keep the whole Super Training, O-power, Pokemon Amie in there. it's too much work to remove at this point
[07:54] <inah8bit> Same. FeelsBadMan
[07:55] <inah8bit> That's why i'm not expecting much this year~
[07:55] <@omegazeron> Pokemon Amie is amazing, specifically for getting a Pokemon with Super Luck and a high crit ratio move, it's 100% crit chance
[07:55] <inah8bit> other than the fact that I'm glad they stopped making pokemon a yearly thing OpieOP
[07:55] <@omegazeron> Absol, looking at you Kappa
[07:55] <inah8bit> the whole Rub your Eevee until it evolves lmao.
[07:56] <inah8bit> Maybe you're avoiding it because of the shitty battle music. Kappa

[07:56] <inah8bit> Apparently there's a whole market for people selling shinies and perfect IV's

[07:59] <inah8bit> Yeah, like some uhhh.. "modders" on DS flashcarts had trouble getting their "cheated in but legit" pokemon through the bank.
[08:00] <@omegazeron> Lol
[08:00] <inah8bit> something about pokemon being tied to trainer ID's and stuff.
03[08:00] * brii_lela (brii_lela@brii_lela.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #battlebuddiesgaming
[08:00] <inah8bit> so magically spawning a pokemon into your bank is difficult, that's why competitive pokemon players just buy pokemon from breeders nowadays. since it's cheaper.
[08:00] <@omegazeron> So I had minimal trouble with this, but I do remember it being a little tough to control

[17:39] <@elygem> psh
[17:40] <geoffplays> OH. When you picked up the yellow rupee, that reminded me... Did they take out the stupid thing each time you start up the game where it tells you the value of every rupee you pick up?
[17:41] <@jaystank> oh god ooccoo WutFace
[17:41] <geoffplays> THANK GOD
[17:42] <modestalchemist> ooccoos lived in the sky, they evolved into the sky people of skyward sword, who then descended down into hyrule
[17:42] <geoffplays> You could always try the good old fashioned super jump slash glitch with the gale boomerang

[18:15] <triplin> Yeah main reason is the motion controls, but also as you mentioned before, world didnt feel connected at all. And the boss fights was pretty boring aswell
[18:16] <triplin> idk, I didnt get the feel
[18:16] <ninjakitty2014> Yeah.. I love the story of Zelda and Link.. But I hate the fact that I couldnt have access to any of the games when I was a young lil' shit.
[18:16] <therichlaprechaun> Link's always put in the weirdest places...They should make a good game with more fighting like large fields with armies of goblins, More side jobs too, and more Free World, you're always going to locations for a reason...You should just have places where there's a nice market, a Zelda game with better possibilities
[18:16] <triplin> Did you completley turn off motion controls on this one? Because I kinda like that you can adjust the aim just a fraction
[18:19] <triplin> You can Z-target hookshot when the arrow show up
[18:19] <triplin> so u can skip 1st person
[18:19] <triplin> on a few parts atleast

[18:53] <weiss122> Yeah I feel you, ALBW tried to go kind of open world I feel with you being able to do the dungeons in whatever order you wanted and I feel that the game kinda suffered for it
[18:53] <mashed_buttons> So ronrey danSad
[18:53] <triplin> Yeah, even this game there's to many parts where it's empty areas
[18:54] <triplin> so im afraid it will be many tedious parts in zelda u
[18:54] <triplin> hope not tho
[18:54] <triplin> Stick it in his butt Keepo
[18:55] <weiss122> Mm, I guess that's a fair point, and to be honest I haven't played ALBW in a few months
[18:55] <weiss122> I did really enjoy the game
[18:55] <mashed_buttons> So wait are we talking about the Zelda that has the trailer with the fancy arrows and the possibly girl-link? Or a different Zelda? Cause I thought that was going to be on the NX not wiiU
[18:56] <weiss122> I felt that there wasn't as strong of a narrative but I think comparing it with most of the other 2D Zeldas that's not necessarily a bad thing
[18:56] <ninjakitty2014> NX?
[18:56] <triplin> I really liked albw, but tbh there wasnt many dungeons I enjoyed. All of them were really short, and pretty easy
[18:56] <triplin> 100%ed it anyway tho
[18:57] <mashed_buttons> @ninjakitty2014 The code name for the next Nintendo console under development
[18:57] <weiss122> If they do it on the NX I think they'll do it like they did with Twilight Princess
[18:57] <ninjakitty2014> oh.. ok .-.
[18:57] <mashed_buttons> Ahh dual platform release
[18:57] <triplin> If they do anything, I think it will be a cross release
[18:58] <weiss122> YEAH that was it, the dungeons didn't feel like they even mattered because you had all the tools from the beginning
[18:58] <weiss122> The game was fun as hell but the dungeons were very lackluster

[00:48] <@battlebuddiesgaming> I'll remote into my PC at home and work on it in a bit
[00:48] <@omegazeron> K
[00:48] <@gamedragonx> Samus and Charizard seem to be the biggest benefactors so far
[00:48] <@omegazeron> Also, just learned Rivals of Aether is on sale, 20% off
[00:48] <@omegazeron> Probably gonna pick that up
[00:48] <darkcloud9269> how bad was Cloud effected?

[00:49] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Oh man, PC Poverty Smash 4Head
[00:49] <@omegazeron> To be fair
[00:49] <bluebeastd> Probably gonna see way more Clouds use Limit SideB over DownB now.
[00:49] <@omegazeron> The game is fun as fuck
[00:49] <@gamedragonx> his up air was nerfed by 1%, his knockback on finishing touch in the air was nerfed. those are confirmed
[00:49] <@battlebuddiesgaming> I've heard
[00:49] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Haven't tried it yet
[00:49] <@omegazeron> I've seen quite a lot of it
[00:49] <@gamedragonx> not sure if his ground KB on finishing touch was changed at all. Some may think his charge time is .5 -1 second slower
[00:49] <@omegazeron> I would go so far as to not even call it a Smash clone in any way
[00:49] <@gamedragonx> just gonna wait for the data miners to figure everything out
[00:49] <darkcloud9269> I've always used S B limit
[00:49] <@omegazeron> It's just a different game in the genre
[00:50] <chato829> his side b is much faster
[00:50] <chato829> easier to take them by surpise
[00:50] <chato829> and a cool finish
[00:50] <darkcloud9269> it is, the Down B everyone perdicts it
[00:50] <sethu2> Yo i can't play wifi

[02:58] <mariostarjr4> GAME 5 HYPE!
[02:58] <@omegazeron> Yeah AJ
[02:58] <masterjoe116> inb4 back throw lol
[02:58] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Also, I really really hate how the game has the characters laid out on the character select
[02:58] <masterjoe116> very nice
[02:58] <@omegazeron> Yeah, it's weird sometimes
[02:58] <@battlebuddiesgaming> They used to always be like by series. Now iut's ... By series. But then CLones get their OWN AREA for some reason. Then DLC
[02:58] <@omegazeron> Yeah
[02:59] <@battlebuddiesgaming> So you have like ... 3 different spots where there are FE characters.
[02:59] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Put them all together
[02:59] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Same with Mario series and pokemon
[02:59] <@omegazeron> And there's like
[02:59] <masterjoe116> Brawl had the best arrangement imo, since it also had the most characters until Smash 4
[02:59] <@omegazeron> Link is at the beginning of the Zelda series, but Toon Link is at the end
[02:59] <@omegazeron> Same with Dr Mario
[02:59] <@battlebuddiesgaming> And then if you have the Mii Fighters it makes the screen look ugly as fuck like Ian's does. I deleted mine because then at least everything LINES UP
[02:59] <@battlebuddiesgaming> And they are stupid 4Head
[02:59] <masterjoe116> YOU CAN DELETE THEM???
[02:59] <masterjoe116> How
[02:59] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Yeah
[02:59] <@omegazeron> Yo some of the Mii Fighters are good
[03:00] <masterjoe116> that's my biggest peeve
[03:00] <masterjoe116> that they even exist in this game
[03:00] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Just go to each one and manually delete them, Joe. Like go to the area you make them at. Once you delete them there
[03:00] <masterjoe116> because Miis are shoe horned into everything and are trash
[03:00] <@battlebuddiesgaming> you disappear from the character select and all your icons line up
[03:00] <masterjoe116> oh
[03:00] <@omegazeron> That's assuming you have all the DLC AJ
[03:00] <masterjoe116> dang you have to delete them from the Mii Maker thing?
[03:00] <@battlebuddiesgaming> I would have been okay if they put in ONE Mii and if all of it's attacks were like Wii Sports themed. That'd be fine. But making them what they did
[03:01] <@battlebuddiesgaming> was stupid
[03:01] <@nightbot> Enjoying the show? Consider dropping a follow, or maybe even subscribing if you REALLY like us!
[03:01] <@omegazeron> Not Mii Maker Masterjoe116
[03:01] <@omegazeron> Custom in Smash
[03:01] <masterjoe116> oh right. ok
[03:01] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Yeah delete the custom miis in Smash
[03:01] <mariostarjr4> GGs my friend
[03:01] <masterjoe116> so you can delete the defaults too
[03:01] <gabussb> gg
[03:01] <masterjoe116> Duck. Still called
[03:01] <masterjoe116> I voted
[03:01] <masterjoe116> I had faith
[03:01] <gabussb> That DHD was just too good
[03:01] <masterjoe116> now give me the bits
[03:01] <masterjoe116> !duff

[03:02] <masterjoe116> dang, the cooldown was too strong
[03:02] <mariostarjr4> You did try, and you did well.
[03:02] <masterjoe116> I think that's a bad mu for Robin because you gotta get in
[03:02] <mariostarjr4> Once you learn the Match up, it gets easier
[03:02] <masterjoe116> Robin is best when he can play defensively

[03:03] <mariostarjr4> Okay
[03:04] <masterjoe116> He said the anxiety get to him
[03:04] <@nightbot> Hey guys, wanna help the stream grow? Consider tweeting it out here: http://ctt.ec/p0URe
[03:04] <gabussb> Ya, I'm a train wreck around crowds
[03:04] <masterjoe116> which I can understand. I had anxiety in brawl tourneys for some reason. But brawl was my entry into competitive smash, so I didn't see how slow it was until PM

[03:05] <masterjoe116> derp
[03:05] <@battlebuddiesgaming> I think a lot of that anxiety comes from just
[03:05] <@battlebuddiesgaming> strong personalities?
[03:05] <masterjoe116> and not having a squad cheering you on
[03:05] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Like when I first went to tournaments it definitely felt awkward as hell, and I really only cared for friendlies
[03:05] <masterjoe116> it's the WORST going to a weekly by yourself
[03:05] <@battlebuddiesgaming> But at the same time if the people there suck their own dicks too hard
[03:06] <@battlebuddiesgaming> It's hard to feel welcomed
[03:06] <masterjoe116> ^
[03:06] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Which surprise. Guess what happens when you put people in a competitive scene 4Head
[03:06] <mariostarjr4> If you find a tournament that either me or my brother, you will have a fun time
[03:06] <gabussb> This FFVI music though.
[03:06] <@omegazeron> Yo how hard was Bryantt9 bopped Kappa
[03:06] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Hour
[03:06] <gabussb> but ya I just struggle dealing with people.
[03:06] <@admiralfunk> !duff
[03:07] <@omegazeron> RIP
[03:07] <@battlebuddiesgaming> I kind of mentioned this on Twitter the other day but

[03:07] <@omegazeron> Nop
[03:07] <@omegazeron> This is such a weird matchup tho
[03:07] <@omegazeron> "How much shit can I throw onto the screen at once"
[03:07] <@battlebuddiesgaming> I'm getting kind of tired of the complete and utter lack of tact people show sometimes as viewers OpieOP

[03:08] <masterjoe116> it's the same principle for me not playign bad Mario Maker levels
[03:09] <@omegazeron> And like, it doesn't happen as often for subs, but even subs aren't exempt from that. Like I don't care if you're paying me, no one needs the dumb negativity you bring

[03:11] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Dude follows the stream, says he hopes they don't nerf Rob. He immediately starts with "Rob is trash who cares?" like... Wow. Way to greet somebody OpieOP
[03:11] <@battlebuddiesgaming> And that pushes people out of OUR stream
[03:11] <masterjoe116> so like, I appreciate you hanging out and tuning in, but that doesn't mean you get to skip lines or DM me all the time and get a response

[03:14] <barrel_with_pointed_earz> Do you only use bowser jr
[03:15] <mariostarjr4> Duck Hunt just can't kill
[03:15] <mariostarjr4> Nothing safe and smashes are unreliable
[03:15] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Sonic, because if I'm fighting Duck Hunt, we're both just throwing projectiles forever
[03:15] <@battlebuddiesgaming> And we both just rack up damage
[03:15] <@battlebuddiesgaming> But then have no kill moves
[03:15] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Because Wii Fit
[03:15] <masterjoe116> lol
[03:16] <@battlebuddiesgaming> @Barrel_with_pointed_earz, Ian's main is Bowser Jr yeah. but he uses Samus too, since the previous games. He'll mess around with just about anyone though
[03:16] <masterjoe116> so what you're saying is Wii Fit is basically a low tier version of Duck Hunt Kappa
[03:16] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Please
[03:16] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Wii Fit is ATLEAST a mid tier Duck Hunt 4Head

[03:17] <@omegazeron> I like how Ian sometimes plays with random non-Omega stages. As opposed to literally everyone else who only does omega/legal stages
[03:17] <@battlebuddiesgaming> ^^^^
[03:17] <masterjoe116> Ian sold me on Gamer. It should be tourney legal
[03:17] <barrel_with_pointed_earz> Oh did they find any Rob changes
[03:17] <@omegazeron> http://smashboards.com/threads/1-1-5-patch-notes.433162/
[03:18] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Nothing on ROB yet
[03:18] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Granted
[03:18] <@battlebuddiesgaming> I think right now character liks ROB won't be checked for a while
[03:18] <@omegazeron> Oh there were DH buffs
[03:18] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Since he's not common
[03:18] <@battlebuddiesgaming> I still gotta wait too to see if anything changed on Wii Fit
[03:18] <@omegazeron> Holy shit the Kirby changelog is huge
[03:18] <@omegazeron> And it's ALL on his hammer
[03:19] <@admiralfunk> smash attack knockback >>>>
[03:19] <@omegazeron> Well, mostly anyway
[03:19] <masterjoe116> crisp bair
[03:19] <masterjoe116> Sakurai stay playing favorites, but Kirby doesn't get any love in this game so that's cool
[03:20] <@omegazeron> Considering Kirby has a LOT of buffs
[03:20] <@omegazeron> He might see more use
[03:20] <masterjoe116> this stage though. I can't get behind this one lol
[03:20] <barrel_with_pointed_earz> Hey whata know they did NERF bayonetta people can stop complaining
[03:21] <@battlebuddiesgaming> They can keep on changing Ganon, but until they actually decide to give him a moveset that isn't absolute booty, he'll forever be bad

[03:22] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Mute City Kreygasm
[03:22] <masterjoe116> I loved great bay
[03:22] <barrel_with_pointed_earz> Pokey floats Kappa
[03:22] <@battlebuddiesgaming> You know the only reason I didn't like PokeFloats was cause like
[03:22] <@battlebuddiesgaming> I'm not a big fan of stages that constantly move
[03:22] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Other than that
[03:22] <@battlebuddiesgaming> I found the design hilarious
[03:23] <@omegazeron> ^
[03:23] <masterjoe116> I think I'm the only one that like those moving stages. Rainbow Cruise, Pokefloats... I didn't like the Mario Bros stage that moved but the other made for some pretty epic fights
[03:23] <@omegazeron> Yo anyone remember those All Star stages for extra challenges or whatever in Melee?
[03:23] <@omegazeron> Like the Majora's Mask stage
[03:23] <barrel_with_pointed_earz> Rage upair kills I think

[03:25] <@battlebuddiesgaming> You know what was bad? Venom
[03:25] <@omegazeron> 3 minutes for the first part, 50 minutes for the second part Kappa
[03:25] <@battlebuddiesgaming> ^^
[03:26] <@omegazeron> I don't really see an issue with Venom
[03:26] <@battlebuddiesgaming> The layout was just weird
[03:26] <@omegazeron> I liked it
[03:26] <@battlebuddiesgaming> I really would have loved to have had a tall stage like Celadon City or Fourside though
[03:26] <@omegazeron> Mhm
[03:26] <@omegazeron> Man, this stage is weird tho
[03:27] <masterjoe116> that freaking porky city stage ruined tall stages for me lol
[03:27] <masterjoe116> and now palutena's temple. good lord
[03:27] <@admiralfunk> gg haha
[03:27] <masterjoe116> that stage is all about the journey
[03:27] <barrel_with_pointed_earz> Xd
[03:27] <@omegazeron> Yo that Porky stage in the Subspace Emissary tho OpieOP
[03:27] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Oh no New Pork City wasn't a "tall" stage
[03:27] <mariostarjr4> Best way to lose a stock
[03:27] <@battlebuddiesgaming> That was just a HuGE stage
[03:27] <masterjoe116> ^ fair enough
[03:27] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Fourside and Celadon aren't comparable to that haha
[03:28] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Palutena's stage in this is AWFUL though. It feels like a 12 year old got a hold of Brawl's stage creator
[03:28] <@omegazeron> AJ, remember the Porky stage for the Subspace? Kappa
[03:28] <@battlebuddiesgaming> which also, Smash 4 has a TERRIBLE stage creator

[03:28] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Yeah I just remember the boss

[03:29] <masterjoe116> yeaaahhh the statue chased you
[03:29] <@battlebuddiesgaming> Yeah
[03:29] <@omegazeron> I know it's an annoying scrolling stage, but tbh I want more stuff like that, where there's stage hazards (like a statue chasing you)
