[00:28] <stopperjj> rooYahaha Nice!
[00:28] <desertech123> wow
[00:29] <desertech123> did you say your beating ganon
[00:29] <stopperjj> About to do the Zora one soon.
[00:29] <stopperjj> #1 for me
[00:29] <desertech123> I've played some zelda games but never something this pretty
[00:30] <bokochaos> Off to get a drink. Might see you later if you're still streaming!
[00:30] <stopperjj> I wanna get the master sword and then do the first divine beast.
[00:32] <desertech123> in zelda games you get something to defeat ganon or a thing for dungeons do you have any
[00:33] <stopperjj> I like that though because it makes the game very non-linear.
[00:33] <stopperjj> Let's you solve the same problem multiple ways
[00:33] <desertech123> but you all ways get a thing but before you need to beat a boss

[00:37] <desertech123> wait that a big rock
[00:37] <stopperjj> I get what you're saying. It definitely is a departure from the planned routes of previous Zelda games and very distinct regions.
[00:38] <desertech123> brb
[00:39] <stopperjj> True. They bleed together a lot.
[00:40] <stopperjj> I think that's something they need to correct if they follow this design in the future.

[02:07] <@elyia_> i got out of bed to turn the light off but somehow my foot was asleep. so like i was like 5% awake on like falling because my ankle would twist to turn the light off. i got to my bed. practically fell over and thats probably why my internet wasnt on on my phone. cause i guess when i fell i turned it off and just passed the fuck out without even realizing.
[02:07] <justdaid> so far yes
03[02:07] * justdaid (justdaid@justdaid.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj

[02:12] <justdaid> so what you are saying is there is no world 2 in mario?
[02:13] <justdaid> does anybody really miss Ganon?
[02:13] <bokochaos> oh... was on the Twitch Presents stream, so I didn't know if I missed anything
03[02:13] * bokochaos (bokochaos@bokochaos.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj

[02:15] <@elyia_> i was messing with the devil
[02:15] <@elyia_> actually i was uh
[02:16] <@elyia_> putting plastic bags away
[02:16] <justdaid> I am in the process of rolling D&D characters :)
[02:16] <bokochaos> Imma run and get a pokestop real quick

[02:22] <justdaid> how are you not stepping on them all the time
[02:23] <justdaid> there are only 100 shrines and I feel like I see one ever 25ft...
[02:23] <@elyia_> 120 shrines
[02:24] <justdaid> apologies, I will go and uninstall life now
[02:26] <justdaid> that is why Hyrule has a Colosseum... you need a place to get elemental weapons
[02:28] <bokochaos> I got a dragon scale and hatched a magnemite in my walk
[02:28] <bokochaos> They do 7th day freebies on them now!
[02:29] <bokochaos> Did I miss the amiibo draws/
[02:29] <bokochaos> They just started 7th day evo items pretty recently

[02:31] <@elyia_> bbgtvCreep
[02:31] <@elyia_> sorry..
[02:31] <@elyia_> i was looking for my remote... again

03[02:32] * chibbyranjo (chibbyranjo@chibbyranjo.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[02:32] <@elyia_> cause i have too much shit in my room
[02:32] <bokochaos> or bluetooth tile markers embedded?
[02:32] <bokochaos> so it beeps the closer you bring your phone to the remote?
[02:33] <justdaid> that would work as well
[02:33] <@elyia_> so what was it
[02:33] <justdaid> he wanted to know if you still play pokego
[02:33] <bokochaos> Then again, I keep my remote in a cup with WiiU styluses and pens
[02:33] <bokochaos> and made my wiiu gamepad my alternate remote when I get lazy
[02:33] <@elyia_> no only because all i ever do is go to work and back and theres no stops along the way
[02:34] <@elyia_> so no pokeballs
[02:35] <bokochaos> >.> I need item slots
[02:35] <bokochaos> too bad my uni is hyper competitive so its hard to stay in gyms for long
[02:36] <@elyia_> okay my beds allllll clean
[02:36] <@elyia_> i forgot riley gave me her cheesies
[02:37] <bokochaos> i tried playing late last night after a pub run. I was low on recovery items and struggled with a blissey on my team in trying to boost myself into a slot
[02:37] <@elyia_> sorry... cheetos bbgtvCreep
[02:39] <@elyia_> these ones have more of a salty taste to em
03[02:39] * chibbyranjo (chibbyranjo@chibbyranjo.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj

[02:39] <@elyia_> but id eat either or depending on the mood
[02:40] <@elyia_> dye it yellow
[02:40] <bokochaos> Huh, war paint design changes with the dye color too
[02:40] <@elyia_> those ones arent the hard ones. yours is the puffy kind
[02:40] <@elyia_> but they were pretty good
[02:41] <@elyia_> dye something yellow for me
[02:41] <@elyia_> the stealth one in yellow is my favorite
[02:42] <@elyia_> god nova is so dumb elyDERP
[02:42] <@elyia_> nooooo

03[03:06] * malcontent77 (malcontent77@malcontent77.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[03:06] <@elyia_> ive never had a beetle before

03[03:08] * fluffykittens808 (fluffykittens808@fluffykittens808.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[03:08] <bokochaos> yay! I was helpful today!
[03:09] <bokochaos> AJ, do you have a Daiso Japan near you?
[03:09] <bokochaos> or in Florida at all??
[03:09] <bokochaos> or wherever you live?
[03:10] <bokochaos> Its like a japanese 99 cent store
[03:10] <bokochaos> If you had one, I would have suggested some paper storage racks that I use as amiibo racks, but ah well
[03:10] <bokochaos> Its pretty international actually
[03:10] <bokochaos> Didn't know if it made it everywhere though
[03:12] <bokochaos> I would send you some, but the shipping would be insane...
[03:12] <bokochaos> I dunno... will see if I get a good income once I get hired and can justify the cost
[03:12] <bokochaos> CA
[03:12] <malcontent77> The lynels, half horse and monster, are the hardest enemies for me
[03:13] <bokochaos> Cause the rack itself is $1.50...
[03:13] <bokochaos> Are you going to Twitch Con this year/
[03:15] <purpleparlourgaming> !sexy

[03:19] <bokochaos> daid, have you beaten Calamity Ganon yourself yet?
[03:20] <triplin> Will you replay the game when "hardmode" comes out
[03:21] <@elyia_> what do i think? i didnt even look at it yet
[03:23] <triplin> I might play it again in a year or so. when the story content dlc releases
[03:23] <cha0tiktvgaming> Someone Claimed Battle Buddies Gaming :P
[03:23] <triplin> Cuz im probably not touching this game until then anyway
[03:24] <cha0tiktvgaming> I'm looking at it right now
[03:25] <bokochaos> There should be a 30 day hold on it
03[03:25] * cha0tiktvgaming (cha0tiktvgaming@cha0tiktvgaming.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[03:25] <bokochaos> Longer for partnered streamers so I heard too

[03:25] <cha0tiktvgaming> He has a count of 5,051,628
[03:25] <cha0tiktvgaming> views
[03:26] <@elyia_> why would i look at the map if im not playing it
[03:26] <cha0tiktvgaming> lol I'm just telling you that either someone just claimed it and the transfer is being made or it's a glitch lmfao
[03:27] <cha0tiktvgaming> I'd try it. Since it's your old name
[03:28] <cha0tiktvgaming> If it doesn't let you then that person I'm seeing is most likely transferring to it as we speak
03[03:29] * tokymongrey (tokymongrey@tokymongrey.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[03:30] <cha0tiktvgaming> I refreshed it and the name is now Undefined... so yeh I think it's a transfer

03[03:31] * notbutterfree_bird (notbutterfree_bird@notbutterfree_bird.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[03:31] <bokochaos> I wonder what this scene is like without the divine beasts
[03:32] <bokochaos> and other stuff
[03:32] <bokochaos> like speed runner status
[03:32] <justdaid> there should be a 90 day hold any any name that is changed from
03[03:32] * juicyjuush (juicyjuush@juicyjuush.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[03:32] <cha0tiktvgaming> @bokochaos if you don't have the divine beasts then you have to fight them as well
[03:32] <cha0tiktvgaming> from what I'm told anyways
[03:32] <triplin> I think you need to beat all versions of ganon if you havnt taken control of any divine beast
[03:32] <triplin> yeah @Cha0tikTVGaming
[03:33] <justdaid> I thought they just powered up GAnon
[03:33] <cha0tiktvgaming> @justDaid I just saw "BattleBuddiesGaming" in my recommended friends and then clicked it... it took me to that page like someone claimed it. So I'm not sure what's going on
[03:33] <justdaid> I am just saying they should, not that is what they are doing
[03:34] <cha0tiktvgaming> Oh, I know. Just saying what's going on.
[03:34] <justdaid> roger
[03:35] <justdaid> #easiestfightever #notmyganon
[03:35] <cha0tiktvgaming> lol
[03:36] <cha0tiktvgaming> his face kinda does look like Ganon... just with that dark nasty shit on it
[03:36] <cha0tiktvgaming> everything else about him I agree with you
[03:36] <@elyia_> i dont have much of an opinion
[03:37] <cha0tiktvgaming> Now he doesn't look anything like Ganon lmfao
[03:37] <cha0tiktvgaming> LMFAO but your inventory is full
[03:37] <bokochaos> ROFL that joke

[03:41] <cha0tiktvgaming> lmfao I've seen people have to start the entire fight over because of the red moon showing up mid fight
[03:42] <cha0tiktvgaming> LMFAO oh shit... might be bad news for you
[03:42] <cha0tiktvgaming> Thats not a blood moon
03[03:42] * notbutterfree_bird (notbutterfree_bird@notbutterfree_bird.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[03:43] <malcontent77> Like a skipping cd
[03:43] <@elyia_> horses suck
[03:43] <justdaid> use his attack to your advantage
[03:44] <cha0tiktvgaming> Music sounds broken
[03:45] <andrewarcade> It's intentional
[03:45] <andrewarcade> rip horse
[03:45] <andrewarcade> didn't know the horse could die LOL

03[03:46] * tokymongrey (tokymongrey@tokymongrey.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[03:47] <malcontent77> Horses I didn't mess with much because the terrain was never flat enough for them to be useful
[03:47] <triplin> What did u think? I thought the fight was really boring. Especially the dark beast ganon fight
[03:47] <triplin> way too easy
03[03:48] * tokymongrey (tokymongrey@tokymongrey.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[03:48] <justdaid> there she is... the girl you have been playing the game for 5000 hours to save... better get a picture quick cause she will be on your screen for 4.3 seconds... except you cannot get a picture...
03[03:49] * sulo54 (sulo54@sulo54.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[03:49] <justdaid> remember, as a rumor, there is a survival and HC modes coming in the DLC
[03:50] <justdaid> maybe it will make the fight harder?
03[03:50] * sulo54 (sulo54@sulo54.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[03:50] <justdaid> some HC game modes change mechanics
[03:51] <triplin> I mean, the champions took away 50% of his health too. So the last boss was felt like 25%, since the last form sucked
[03:52] <justdaid> The game play all the way through is 9/10... last fight is like 4/10
03[03:52] * cha0tiktvgaming (cha0tiktvgaming@cha0tiktvgaming.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[03:53] <malcontent77> I still loved the game. But i enjoyed the first half of my time with it than the latter half.
[03:53] <justdaid> plus you can have like unlimited faeries
03[03:53] * cha0tiktvgaming (cha0tiktvgaming@cha0tiktvgaming.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[03:54] <justdaid> I really liked the idea of the shrines but I really miss 7-9 well thought out dungeons
[03:55] <triplin> Yeah, I loved shrines too, and even the divine beasts. But I really wanted some traditional dungeons. Searching for small keys and compasses ;z
[03:56] <justdaid> The great plateau is 10/10 rest of the game combined is like 7/10
03[03:56] * clarencecross_ (clarencecross_@clarencecross_.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[03:57] <justdaid> you get and see everything you will in the game on the great plateau
[03:57] <justdaid> is Hyrule a roman society now?
[03:57] <justdaid> did you get all of the memories?
03[03:57] * clarencecross_ (clarencecross_@clarencecross_.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[03:58] <malcontent77> Makes me wonder if they will do a second switch Zelda and how it will build on this
[03:58] <bokochaos> How will they live up to anything after this zelda is a bigger question

[03:58] <bokochaos> this and OoT are gonna be the baselines for the rest of history
[03:59] <triplin> I wanted more voice acting and character bulding with the champions too
[04:00] <justdaid> BotW2 : Hyrule 3k City Builder
[04:00] <bokochaos> This game had so much to do...
[04:00] <malcontent77> The Zora section was my favorite part
[04:00] <bokochaos> and allows you to run and climb and jump voluntarily
[04:00] <@elyia_> oll punch you
[04:00] <@elyia_> ill
[04:01] <@elyia_> BabyRage
[04:01] <tigerofthegale> What game is next AJ?

[04:01] <triplin> in the map

[04:02] <cha0tiktvgaming> would've been funny af if 100+ people were in here to see that
[04:02] <tokymongrey> dawg! Saw you just knock down Da man himself! Whass poppin!
[04:03] <tigerofthegale> I've seen someone do that while playing a fighting game but never a Zelda
[04:03] <justdaid> the DLC content will allegedly contain a new original story, a new dungeon, and additional challenges??
[04:03] <justdaid> in Winter
[04:03] <triplin> Im gussing 35% clearrate

[04:05] <justdaid> how do you only have 34%
[04:05] <justdaid> WTF
[04:05] <triplin> I had 40.80 or so, but I had more seeds than you
[04:05] <triplin> that's why I close

[04:05] <justdaid> if you have all the shrines how do you not have at least 50%
[04:06] <malcontent77> First I've known about the %
[04:06] <justdaid> 100% speed runs are going to have to start a week before AGDQ
[04:06] <malcontent77> I'm guessing the seeds are the big % since there are so many
[04:06] <bokochaos> not chests?
[04:07] <bokochaos> each item is like .08%
[04:07] <@elyia_> 900 koroks is a lot
[04:08] <triplin> That's probably coming with the dlc "additional map feature"
[04:08] <triplin> is probably something like that
[04:08] <triplin> find koroks

[04:11] <malcontent77> I liked it much more than ff15
[04:11] <triplin> I loved the game. It was a really long time since I enjoyed a game this much
[04:12] <triplin> then ofcourse, there's part I dont like
[04:12] <bokochaos> It has flaws that you would not expect from being in development so long
[04:12] <malcontent77> I still haven't played nier automata but persona 5 is coming soon I may not get to it until afrrr
[04:12] <bokochaos> Like missing texture on parts of walls
[04:12] <justdaid> Persona 5 PogChamp

[04:12] <justdaid> so excited

[04:15] <bokochaos> and through work
[04:15] <justdaid> I bought a vita just for it, felt like I kind of rushed it... would like to play again, but I am not getting a vita just for that again

[04:34] <justdaid> then I will give you my kids friend codes... they need non asshats to play with
[04:34] <malcontent77> I wonder if monster hunter will ever come out of the PlayStation again. A full fledged monster hunter 5 with psn online would be glorious
[04:34] <@elyia_> <3
[04:34] <justdaid> Sony is going to have to suck a lot of Capcom dick to get MH back on the PS line
[04:35] <ryushura> sony has a MH game its called toukiden 2
[04:35] <justdaid> I mean, if that was a MH game it would be called MH right?
[04:36] <malcontent77> I haven't played God water or toukiden even though I heard both series were similar to monster hunter
[04:36] <ryushura> i call toukiden 2 sony MH game
[04:37] <malcontent77> God eater I mean
[04:37] <justdaid> that aside... is Toukiden any good?
[04:37] <justdaid> on PC
[04:37] <ryushura> u would have to ask sammy i think he plays it on pc
[04:37] <justdaid> he plays 2?

[04:38] <ryushura> i just got gen so i have my hands full trying to get armor right now

[04:44] <justdaid> PSA: the Switch has an AC band for the WiFi
[04:45] <justdaid> most routers that you can buy have the B&G bands on them... the new band is AC, if you have a router that has the AC band then the switch can use it
[04:47] <justdaid> the AC band on a router is shorter distance but a stronger signal... also uses a different frequency so if you have a lot f wireless devices its worth it

[05:09] <@elyia_> its crazy how the nurse would just do that though
[05:09] <zenheadshot> but overall its a fairly saddening story
[05:10] <justdaid> it was 1980 and my parents were 19 & 20 and as an older lady she thought she knew better
[05:10] <justdaid> plus my dad really was drunk

[05:13] <@elyia_> its so expensive
[05:14] <justdaid> because I have lived in 3 states its about $400 and its hard to justify that just for a name change that I have already dealt with my whole life

03[02:54] * hxh_leorio (hxh_leorio@hxh_leorio.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[02:54] <glackum> Specter Knight was fun, its got new levels and new enemies and new boss patterns & new bosses & stuff
[02:55] <glackum> it has a higher learning curve than shovel knight but lower than plague knight
[02:55] <glackum> i felt like the levels & controls arent as tight though
03[02:55] * hxh_leorio (hxh_leorio@hxh_leorio.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[02:57] <glackum> well its harder than shovel knight, but if you're good at plague knight then i guess so? if you're bad at plague knight id say plague knight is the hardest
[02:57] <glackum> the bosses have new patterns that make them a little stronger, but specter knight is stronger than shovel knight
[02:58] <xbrcat> Fistpunch what a name. i think thats going to be the name for my first born if i have children. probably never going to happen not a big fan of being a parent.
03[02:59] * ericdave23 (ericdave23@ericdave23.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[02:59] <glackum> is the no bottomless pit achievement really as rare as the no death achievement
[03:00] <glackum> i dont think anything has more hp
[03:00] <glackum> you take more damage, turkeys turn to bombs
[03:01] <glackum> less checkpoints
[03:01] <xbrcat> does dark souls have a no dearth trophy. i want to know if it does has anyone got it.
[03:05] <xbrcat> i would love a new Castlevania game. To bad koniami gone crazy. Dont know why castlevania pop up. :D :D
[03:05] <glackum> i mean, bloodstained will be a thing eventually
[03:05] <xbrcat> true
[03:06] <glackum> but if its the original games.....i dont really like them
[03:06] <glackum> i played the original castlevania and despised it as a kid, never liked the rest of the series.
[03:06] <glackum> i was told super castlevania lV was better, so i played it
[03:07] <glackum> finished in in 6 hours, all i can say is fuck stairs
[03:07] <glackum> the only really fun part of the game for me was the boss rush at the end
[03:08] <glackum> I finished SoTN blind as well for the first time like 2 weeks ago, and that was a good time
[03:08] <glackum> was a bit peeved like 70% of the boses did 1 damage to me though
[03:08] <glackum> bosses*

[03:10] <glackum> i didnt mind the second castle, seemed neat
[03:10] <xbrcat> i love castlevania. i played 1, 3 i used to play them on a nes website its been shut down, because nintendo shut them down. i want to play 4 and Dracula X the only version not the snes.
[03:11] <xbrcat> original version
[03:11] <glackum> I think Dracula X is the next casltevania game ill try
[03:11] <glackum> if i dont like that either im just done with them

[03:13] <xbrcat> i call it Dracula X original version, because i can never remember the name.
[03:14] <glackum> i didnt realized the inverted castle was so hated, i was so fixated on covering the whole map and seeing the bosses in them, i didnt really care about it being the entire castle inverted
[03:15] <glackum> a couple of other people i know dont seem to like it either
[03:15] <glackum> i guess its more of a snooze on subsequent playthroughs though(even if getting around is super fast at that point)
03[03:15] * bokochaos (bokochaos@bokochaos.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[03:16] <glackum> YES
[03:16] <glackum> i was so sick of hearing the same music NotLikeThis
[03:18] <glackum> my two complaints were that the bosses did like no damage(even dracula did 1 damage), the knockback & the same music in inverted castle
[03:18] <xbrcat> also rondo of blood is also on psp, but you have to buy the remake and beat that just to play the original
[03:18] <glackum> the only song that was unique in the inverted castle was the salem area
[03:18] <glackum> the rest was that one song, and that one other song
[03:19] <inah8bit> im doing okay.
[03:19] <inah8bit> almost done 100%ing NieR

[03:20] <inah8bit> Its very weird.
[03:20] <xbrcat> well i got to go to bed goodnight and dont forget to... i dont remember what i was going to say. :D :D
[03:20] <inah8bit> and yeah. im kinda biased towards it cause I loved the PS3 game.
[03:20] <inah8bit> like.. LOVE.
[03:20] <glackum> theres no checkpoint in ng+ until after the fish for this stage
[03:20] <inah8bit> rip in peace
[03:21] <glackum> yes
[03:21] <inah8bit> Its kind of a cult hit in japan and the west
[03:22] <inah8bit> much like dark souls is, but.. not really
[03:22] <inah8bit> You should listen to the OST sometime it's probably the best in terms of RPGs
[03:22] <inah8bit> and that's saying a lot since RPG OSTs are alawyas godlike.
[03:23] <bokochaos> I actually met a shovel knight dev at my uni. He signed my amiibo
[03:24] <inah8bit> thats cool.
[03:24] <glackum> if you're not consistent at the game, the best way to get the speedrun trophy is to go to the menu if you think you're going slow/dying in a stage; going back to the title menu during a stage resets your progress and therefore doesnt count that time you spent
[03:24] <bokochaos> and then I f-ed up and didn't put it in my backpack properly so it got a little bent..
[03:24] <inah8bit> :(
[03:24] <bokochaos> yeah...
[03:25] <@gamedragonx> I like that theme
[03:25] <inah8bit> Keith o/
[03:25] <@gamedragonx> HeyGuys
[03:25] <inah8bit> LOL
[03:25] <inah8bit> Yeahhhhhhhh
[03:25] <inah8bit> cause that's what the steam button on the steam controller does
[03:25] <inah8bit> you'd think Steam would be original Kappa
[03:25] <inah8bit> I hate big picture mode
[03:25] <bokochaos> they apparently spent a good amount of time talking to speedrunners on some of the level designs
[03:25] <inah8bit> Steam Controller works without it
[03:26] <glackum> why not do speedrun, penny pincher, deathless, bottomless, true shovelry all in the same run
[03:26] <glackum> you'll reset levels a lot buy hey BrokeBack
[03:27] <glackum> but*

[04:49] <snappaman> Plus you can sharpen a shovel.

[01:08] <justdaid> I am not that big a fan, but I have been getting into the SMT universe much much more... and I loved P4G
[01:08] <@actfast231> Persona 4 Golden may be one of my fav games of all time.
[01:08] <@actfast231> So... I'm slightly excited for P5 bbgtvA

[03:13] <zenheadshot> I'm glad to hear you at least played the original, how far have you made it? :o
[03:14] <zenheadshot> in the new one i mean
[03:14] <malcontent77> Started second rout with 9s
[03:14] <zenheadshot> Nice :D
[03:15] <malcontent77> Nier on PS3 was a flawed but interesting game with a lot of cool quirks. This combat is way better in automata
[03:15] <zenheadshot> I dont want to spoil anything, but theres more than one pipe you can go into, and its definitely worth investigating after the cave in

[03:16] <malcontent77> Yes so I have seen the returning character
[03:17] <zenheadshot> its the same for both of them, but for a secret boss you do need to be 9s (its max level so dont go for it yet lmao)
[03:17] <malcontent77> But haven't found all of the memories yet
[03:18] <zenheadshot> So you've seen the returning character, but have you searched for the flowers and gone down the elevator?

[03:11] <@brothervirtue> well that sux. hope you figure it.
[03:11] <juicyjuush> I don't think bitrate effects it
[03:11] <juicyjuush> I'm not sure tho :p
[03:12] <@brothervirtue> 264x nvenc etc? encoding type ?
[03:12] <juicyjuush> depending on gpu might be better to use that instead of cpu
[03:12] <juicyjuush> :s
[03:12] <juicyjuush> especially if you're playing on your ps4
[03:13] <juicyjuush> idk much about xsplit tho
[03:13] <@simplyaj> Codec is set as uhh
[03:13] <@brothervirtue> I didnt have a good xsplit experience 3-4 years ago
[03:13] <@simplyaj> x264? Should it be NVENC?
[03:13] <juicyjuush> what gfx card do you use?
[03:14] <juicyjuush> cuz nvenc uses that to encode
[03:14] <@simplyaj> CPU: Intel Core i7-4790K 4.0GHz Quad-Core ProcessorVideo Card: MSI GeForce GTX 970 4GB Twin Frozr V
[03:14] <juicyjuush> oh shit
[03:14] <juicyjuush> your cpu should be fine
[03:14] <juicyjuush> idk then :O
[03:15] <juicyjuush> sorry man D:
[03:15] <@simplyaj> Well then 4Head
[03:15] <juicyjuush> what did task manager say was using most of the cpu?
[03:15] <@simplyaj> I didn't have these problems before the name change and it went and redid all my settings, and I don't remember how they were set
[03:15] <@simplyaj> There's a shit ton of processes for
[03:15] <@simplyaj> CefCOM3 Process (32 Bit)
03[03:16] * inah8bit (inah8bit@inah8bit.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[03:16] <juicyjuush> can I post links here?
[03:16] <@simplyaj> Yup
[03:16] <juicyjuush> https://www.reddit.com/r/xsplit/comments/47533h/cefcom3_process_maxing_cpu/
[03:16] <juicyjuush> maybe that can help :o
[03:17] <@simplyaj> Looks like people complaining but nothing being done
[03:18] <juicyjuush> >.<
[03:18] <@simplyaj> Hmmm
[03:19] <juicyjuush> try to lower your bitrate and frame rate
[03:19] <@simplyaj> I can lower bitrate some but
[03:19] <@simplyaj> Lowering framerate would really be shitty going from 60 to 30
[03:20] <juicyjuush> yea
[03:20] <juicyjuush> hmm
[03:20] <@simplyaj> I did change it from 1080p to 720p
[03:20] <@simplyaj> to see if that'll help
[03:21] <juicyjuush> that should help
[03:21] <juicyjuush> but it's super weird that you could stream fine before but now you can't
[03:21] <@simplyaj> Yeah
[03:22] <@simplyaj> Like when I put the new account in, I have no idea what settings were changed, but they also had an update too
[03:22] <juicyjuush> chrome and firefox can use a lot of cpu as well depending on what you have open in tabs
[03:23] <@simplyaj> I just have chat popped out and the dashboard open for Chrome
[03:23] <@simplyaj> after closing XSplit CPU usage went down to 5% though
[03:24] <@simplyaj> Opening it puts me up to 50%
[03:24] <@simplyaj> I'll go live and see what happens
[03:25] <@simplyaj> gonna spam a bunch of text to see how the frame rate looks on th text box real fast

[04:32] <malcontent77> I'm the same. I love metal gear, but generally don't like stealth. Because it's one of the few series that's actually good at it.
[04:33] <xbrcat> you can shoot him and he will go down, but he will only stay down for a minute or 2

[04:35] <malcontent77> I horsed around with the older ones back in the day but never completed them
[04:36] <xbrcat> Resident Evil 7 is a mix of classic resident evil with outlast. in my opinion.
[04:36] <@elyia_> id like it to be a yellow one cause you dont see them a lot besides like i guess 14 that i know of
[04:36] <@elyia_> but idk how itd be on my skin

[04:38] <xbrcat> them like he will chase you down the broken staircase
[04:39] <xbrcat> well until you get down the basement.
[04:39] <malcontent77> A lot of people say this is amazing if you have PlayStation VR
[04:40] <xbrcat> that is the only time he stops chasing when you get down the basement

[14:21] <cobaltios> Would you have played this on VR if you were able to?
[14:21] <@elyia_> ajjjj
[14:22] <@elyia_> i do like tea but it depends what kind
[14:22] <@elyia_> and ya im just coughing im not like having anything else
[14:22] <codon2> make careful decisions
[14:22] <codon2> there wont be any more of the bank storage past this point
[14:23] <zenheadshot> Well it works with any kind, and you may end up liking it even more. It also should help with your coughing. Try mixing a tsp or two of honey into it
[14:23] <zenheadshot> @Elyia_,
[14:23] <@elyia_> everyone suggests honey, i dont like honey
[14:23] <@elyia_> BibleThump
[14:24] <codon2> or u can opt
[14:24] <codon2> to have any sweet
[14:24] <zenheadshot> Thats why you mix it in the Tea Poooound i dont like honey either, but i cant really taste it in tea
[14:24] <codon2> a candy will do for the throat
[14:25] <codon2> sugar ease the pain in the throat

[14:42] <cobaltios> AFAIK, the Umbrella logo is usually "red", right?
[14:42] <cobaltios> So... "reformed" Umbrella?
[14:43] <puffmax> My guess is in RE6 Umbrella fucked up so bad the world government banded together and took control of Umbrella for crimes, placed people like Redfeild in charge and rebranded it to clean up shit like Evie
[14:44] <cobaltios> ^
[14:44] <cobaltios> That sounds plausible.

[14:47] <puffmax> It was kinda spooky in the beginnning when you were less equip, then at the end you were just fukin shit up, it felt like RE1
[14:47] <cobaltios> Many of those that liked old school RE seem to really enjoy this game.
[14:48] <puffmax> I was really expecting the dead cop to play a bigger role as a threat
[14:48] <puffmax> my guess is there will be more Lucas story in a DLC
[14:49] <puffmax> So the serum will calcify anyone that been too far infected, that's why it calcifies Jack
[14:50] <puffmax> in the notes they mentioned the Serum is less of a cure and more for neutralizing targets

[14:52] <puffmax> unless Evie can control the degrees in which people progress, but we don't know that
[14:53] <puffmax> so maybe since Evie liked Mia she only gave her a minor infection
[14:53] <puffmax> this sounds like we're talking about people giving each other herpes or so shit
[14:54] <puffmax> yo the mom was kinda hot in her days

[16:40] <stopperjj> You can cheese the fuck out of Ganon IMO. Next time I do it I bet I could do it in less than a minute with enough supplies.
[16:41] <stopperjj> Now that I know his attack pattern, I could do it much faster.
[16:42] <stopperjj> Damn it Mipha... rooPs
[16:43] <stopperjj> He assimilated guardian weapons and tech.
[16:44] <stopperjj> The beast Ganon was more true to form but that part of the fight was the same as the Vah Ruta entry fight.

[01:47] <notbutterfree_bird> I did hear the time limit was shorter for dungeons compared to previous games.
[01:47] <ericdave23> go back to save room in the palace ones you killed the enemies then save then load data there should be spawns again
[01:48] <@jaystank> that's not the problem, limited sp is
[01:48] <ericdave23> oh
[01:48] <justdaid> so the save pionts work like bon fires?
[01:48] <@actfast231> Aaaaand looks like I gotta dip because my shit internet can't play this stream at 240p without buffering every 3 seconds.
[01:48] <@elyia_> you dont even need to reload if you leave the room and go back to one
[01:48] <notbutterfree_bird> Game's pretty stingy with SP recovery.
[01:49] <@elyia_> they spawn back too
[01:49] <@actfast231> I must go and expel the salt within me

[20:55] <andrewarcade> I would just be matter of fact with it, just explain how you were updating your emotes assuming the slots were permanent only to find out it wasn't. Then Twitch made the changes to have it be permanent a few weeks later and ask if there's any way they can give you back your original emote count

[21:39] <@samurai71> i mean acid jazz is theme of the music
[21:40] <andrewarcade> I think in time you'll understand it more and more
[21:41] <andrewarcade> Each Persona has a Major Arcana assigned to it such as Chariot, Death, Devil, Magician, Priestess, Lovers, etc.
[21:41] <andrewarcade> And each Confidant has a Major Arcana set to them
[21:41] <@gamedragonx> well the game averages like 120 hours, so that sounds about right
[21:41] <andrewarcade> The higher level the confidants are, the more bonus EXP you get when fusing personas
[21:41] <@gamedragonx> I had to redo the first palace and I'm only just starting the second ,and I still have like 14 hours
[21:42] <andrewarcade> Certain Confiants also give you bonuses and perks as you level them up. :)
[21:42] <andrewarcade> Like that doctor adds more to her stock in her shop and such
[21:43] <@gamedragonx> well if the time expires it sends you back a week in time
[21:43] <@gamedragonx> but I just happened to save two save points by mistake, and it was like halfway done with the place. so I only had to redo half
[21:43] <andrewarcade> It's all up to you, I focused on Confiants first and then stats later.
[21:43] <@gamedragonx> but then before that I died to a random monster after playing for an hour without saving
[21:44] <andrewarcade> Sometimes you'll need certain stats to hang out with Confidants though
[21:44] <andrewarcade> I just like hanging out with the confidants because you find out a lot of background story
[21:44] <andrewarcade> Yeah a lot more story with confiants
[21:45] <@gamedragonx> funny enough that actually ends up being a pretty good trade lol
[21:46] <@jaystank> coffee's an sp item, strong trade VoHiYo
[21:46] <@samurai71> i mean coffee is pretty much a acquired, may as well learn how to make good coffee

[21:48] <andrewarcade> Just remember
[21:48] <@gamedragonx> I think the biggest thing for me is that this is also my first Persona, and I had no idea it was also a life sim
[21:48] <andrewarcade> You're literally unable to do everything your first playthrough
[21:48] <andrewarcade> No matter how you play it
[21:48] <@gamedragonx> I mean, I played Tokyo Mirage Sessions so I expected a little something
[21:48] <andrewarcade> you're going to miss a LOT of stuff
[21:48] <andrewarcade> It's just how the game is designed
[21:48] <@gamedragonx> but still
[21:48] <andrewarcade> So just try to not worry about it
[21:48] <andrewarcade> New Game + allows you to catch up on all the stuff you missed out on
[21:48] <andrewarcade> And you can skip scenes really fast with the option fast forward button
[21:48] <andrewarcade> And make items so shadows can't see you
[21:48] <@gamedragonx> that was the Shin Megumi x Fire Emblem crossover for Wii U last year
[21:48] <@gamedragonx> I really enjoyed it
[21:48] <@samurai71> yep
[21:49] <andrewarcade> So you can quickly get to the areas you missed the first time around
[21:49] <@gamedragonx> I tell everyone I know to try it lol

[21:51] <andrewarcade> claraLOL
[21:51] <@gamedragonx> sorry fam, I traded it in a long time ago to help pay for switch. Stuff got bonuses
[21:52] <andrewarcade> lmao
[21:52] <@jaystank> the treasure is probably ass anyway MVGame
[21:52] <andrewarcade> ^
[21:52] <andrewarcade> Honestly the locked treasures usually are crap lol
[21:52] <@gamedragonx> is it? Oh well, the Wii U you'd play it on is about to be rarer
[21:53] <@gamedragonx> I hear people who've played other Persona's dont like his voice this time (apparently he's a recurring character)
[21:53] <@gamedragonx> since its my first time I dont mind
[21:53] <@jaystank> igor's voice in 3 and 4 is pretty much the opposite
[21:53] <@gamedragonx> and they stopped making Wii Us like late last year
[21:53] <@jaystank> very high pitched, old man-y
[21:53] <@jaystank> instead of deep buttersmooth
[21:53] <andrewarcade> Yeah lol
[21:54] <andrewarcade> They've done some similar things in the past
[21:54] <andrewarcade> Like Chie in P4 vs P4G
[21:54] <andrewarcade> A very drastic voice change
[21:54] <@jaystank> oh yeah, i forgot they changed chie's voice in golden
[21:54] <@gamedragonx> I'm really enjoying the game so far, despite being so early in
[21:54] <@gamedragonx> might go back and play other personas later on
[21:55] <@gamedragonx> I own 3 and 4 from PSN sales already
[21:55] <@gamedragonx> might even buy the eventual P5U just for support
[21:55] <@samurai71> yeah
[21:55] <andrewarcade> yeah you can summon again from compendium
[21:55] <@jaystank> as long as the persona isn't on you directly, you can get a new one
[21:55] <andrewarcade> Or find them from the palace again
[21:56] <andrewarcade> summoning from compendium cost money though
[21:56] <@gamedragonx> I think thats the point of registering them right? so that you can summon them again?
[21:56] <andrewarcade> Yea pretty much :o
[21:56] <andrewarcade> Also updating them with higher levels / better skills
[21:56] <@jaystank> base level is the only thing that matters in fusion
[21:57] <@jaystank> you'll probably run into a kelpie pretty quickly
[21:58] <@jaystank> and definitely not pyro jack

[22:07] <@gamedragonx> which is surprising since he's half a ghost horse
[22:08] <andrewarcade> I think they like funny responses
[22:08] <@gamedragonx> you should probably save off the image that shows the 4 types and what types of answers they like/dislike
[22:08] <@gamedragonx> I even typed it in my phone

[22:10] <@jaystank> you great
[22:12] <@jaystank> as long as you're hidden, you can't be found, so you can jump around all you want
[22:12] <@jaystank> ... "as long as you're hidden, you can't be found" good job, me
[22:12] <@jaystank> that's as good as "people die if they're killed"
[22:13] <@gamedragonx> I didn't, but it warms my heart
[22:15] <@jaystank> the angle to ambush from hiding is pretty narrow
[22:15] <@gamedragonx> I haven't minded Morgana yet. Although Jay has informed me that there will be a character that will I will auto-waifu and put in my party

[17:19] <arpeeph> yeah.. but I wanna max my SOCIAL and CONFIDANT links too..
[17:20] <arpeeph> so when I do a dungeon.. I always GRIND like 10+ hours for levels,money and items.
[17:20] <arpeeph> so i Only spend like a Day or 2 to complete one mission and do all my maxing the days left.
[17:20] <handlebar_orionx> I saw the new trailerfor Marvel VS Capcom Infinite, it looks pretty sick
[17:21] <handlebar_orionx> Although regular Sigma as I guess a preorder bonus is kinda bull
[17:21] <serp_it> Btw AJ, have you considered playing Hollow Knight?
[17:21] <serp_it> It's pretty fantastic
[17:21] <serp_it> if you like Metroidvanias
[17:22] <arpeeph> but Music in Hollow Knight is pretty boring compared to this game. @Serp_it can't play that game for too long. I get sleepy :D
[17:23] <serp_it> Fair enough, but I think you're missing out
[17:23] <handlebar_orionx> I'd say the 8-bit art style is more boring and overdone than the hand drawn style
[17:23] <handlebar_orionx> Except for how most indie games use washed out instagram filter colors of mauve
[17:23] <serp_it> I honestly wasn't that enticed either after watching the trailer, but fell in love with the game once I actually played it
[17:24] <serp_it> And it really IS a Metroidvania, moreso than many others, plus it has a rather baffling amount of content to comparable games
[17:24] <handlebar_orionx> I'm kind of sick of everything using mauve and beige tones to everything or make everything seem washed out
[17:24] <handlebar_orionx> It's the 2010's version of lense flare
[17:24] <handlebar_orionx> Everything uses that washed out 60's picture color pallet
[17:25] <serp_it> Haha you would fucking hate Sundered
[17:26] <serp_it> Did you? I also played the alpha, but it has everything you just described
[17:26] <serp_it> hand-drawn, washed-out colors, camera zooming ridiculously far away
[17:27] <serp_it> Yeah, even the alpha the regular backers got was pretty easily broken
[17:28] <handlebar_orionx> Hipsters especially are just obsessed with making everything tones of mauve, pink, beige and washed out greens and blues

[00:51] <mrtorturel> hey aj
[00:51] <mrtorturel> you're starting to drop frames :(
[00:52] <@simplyaj> i refreshed
[00:52] <@simplyaj> stream might drop for a sec
[00:52] <@simplyaj> i don't know
[00:53] <@simplyaj> i don't know how to beat this fucking boss on hard
[00:54] <mrtorturel> how much damage does the dread talon deal in hard?
[00:54] <@simplyaj> It's the fact that my darkness and will are combined
[00:54] <@simplyaj> so i have very little options
[00:55] <@simplyaj> i think amulet coin might be the best option right now
[00:56] <mrtorturel> I can tell. and what about the barrier lantern?
[00:56] <@simplyaj> could try
[00:56] <mrtorturel> but the barrier leaves you exposed with your health now that they're combined
[00:56] <mrtorturel> you could try later
[00:57] <mrtorturel> in the battle
[00:57] <mrtorturel> ohhh chrono is a good choice

[01:05] <@simplyaj> jesus
[01:06] <mrtorturel> those flals
[01:06] <mrtorturel> falls
[01:07] <@simplyaj> I really dislike the dash slash
[01:07] <mrtorturel> it's quite useless against her dash
[01:07] <mrtorturel> whenever she's doing it
[01:08] <@simplyaj> It just doesn't homing attack when you need it to
[01:08] <mrtorturel> if you want to play it safe, better consider going after her when she's up and not whenever she's dashing
[01:08] <mrtorturel> i think that's because of the distance
[01:09] <mrtorturel> there's a small gap where you have to be to actually nail the hit
03[01:09] * optimusprimal12 (optimusprimal12@optimusprimal12.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[01:11] <@simplyaj> FUCK
[01:11] <@simplyaj> god
[01:11] <@simplyaj> hate this shit
[01:12] <mrtorturel> the second half foreces you to play it safe. it's stupid
[01:12] <@simplyaj> Well like
03[01:12] * optimusprimal12 (optimusprimal12@optimusprimal12.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[01:12] <@simplyaj> sometimes you have invincibility for a few frames of that attack
[01:12] <@simplyaj> other times you just don't?
[01:12] <@simplyaj> Or like the attack PUTS you where she is going to be
[01:12] <@simplyaj> so you can't help but take a hit
[01:12] <mrtorturel> I think you don't have to attack her head on
[01:13] <mrtorturel> if she dashes against you, it's better to get her from the opposite way
03[01:13] * wolfhandle (wolfhandle@wolfhandle.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[01:13] <@simplyaj> THERE
[01:14] <mrtorturel> yes!
[01:14] <mrtorturel> that was a lucky streak
[01:14] <wolfhandle> Aloha e AJ and friends~ HeyGuys
[01:14] <mrtorturel> hey there
[01:14] <mrtorturel> oh hell
[01:15] <@simplyaj> oi
[01:16] <mrtorturel> lol
[01:16] <wolfhandle> is this hard mode or something?
[01:16] <@simplyaj> There
[01:16] <@simplyaj> Done with that Feat
[01:17] <@simplyaj> Yes
[01:17] <@simplyaj> It was hard mode
[01:17] <mrtorturel> nice
[01:17] <mrtorturel> good job
[01:17] <wolfhandle> Jeez that's pretty touch as nails
[01:17] <@simplyaj> Honestly I sped through most of Hard mode
[01:18] <@simplyaj> But the enchantress was pretty tough
[01:18] <@simplyaj> Final Dark Knight fight was tough too
[01:19] <@simplyaj> 4 feats remain. Gonna try to do them all together
[01:19] <wolfhandle> Poor spectator knight though
[01:19] <wolfhandle> his story was kinda rough
[01:19] <@simplyaj> "Spectator Knight"
[01:19] <@simplyaj> He just watches things
[01:20] <wolfhandle> i guess NotLikeThis
[01:21] <wolfhandle> yet i kinda relate to him in a different way
[01:21] <mrtorturel> I really dig Specter's morph at the end. It's a nice nod to Shovel Knight
[01:21] <@simplyaj> Whoops
[01:21] <@simplyaj> didn't mean to skip that wanted to look at my times
[01:21] <@simplyaj> for those levels
[01:21] <mrtorturel> oh
[01:21] <@simplyaj> oh well
[01:22] <@simplyaj> I should be able to combine all four of these but
[01:22] <@simplyaj> I will have to spend some money so we'll see
[01:22] <@simplyaj> Cause I gotta get a few upgrades
03[01:23] * redshiner (redshiner@redshiner.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[01:23] <@simplyaj> to make things faster
[01:23] <@simplyaj> I suppose if I don't get the money one, that's the one feat that I don't mind replaying the game for
[01:23] <@simplyaj> Doing this in an hour and 30 is the hardest one of these four so I'll be saving a lot and copying my file like I did with the other characters
[01:24] <mrtorturel> how much did it take you on hard mode now?
[01:24] <mrtorturel> to get it done
03[01:24] * redshiner (redshiner@redshiner.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[01:26] <mrtorturel> I'd like to see you do the enchantress now without crono in this playthrough. Kappa
[01:27] <@simplyaj> Won't be too bad haha
[01:27] <@simplyaj> Gonna start this over though
[01:27] <@simplyaj> And I have no clue how long it took because on new game + it combines both run times on the file
[01:27] <mrtorturel> right
[01:31] <inah8bit> DARKNESS
[01:31] <@simplyaj> Oi
[01:31] <@simplyaj> Yeah but you'l see me going back to the title screen a lot to make copies of my file if you're wondering
[01:31] <inah8bit> Aloha
[01:31] <wolfhandle> Aloha e Inah~ HeyGuys
[01:37] <mrtorturel> Imma gonna get some sleep. It's stupid late. Good luck with the playthrough.

[04:57] <inah8bit> the term just means something like
[04:57] <inah8bit> if you don't like a result in yoru vdieo game you just load an earlier save etc etc.
[04:57] <inah8bit> yeh.
[04:58] <inah8bit> basically just doing anything with saves that isn't just saving to continue your game is save scumming.
[04:58] <inah8bit> Yeahh the term is very weird.
[04:58] <inah8bit> but then again lots of video game coined words are.
[04:59] <inah8bit> like. having multiple saves for skyrim for different story outcomes is save scumming too.

[03:55] <andrewarcade> Yeah
[03:55] <andrewarcade> It's 1 - 3
[03:55] <andrewarcade> Rewatching must not give as much
[03:55] <andrewarcade> You can also only watch a movie two times each month I think
[03:55] <andrewarcade> Hmm it's not really RNG based
[03:55] <andrewarcade> There's certain things that will change it
[03:56] <andrewarcade> For instance there's a book store eventually that lets you get more benefits from watching movies
[03:56] <andrewarcade> So you'll get more than 1 note
[03:56] <andrewarcade> There's also similar books for other things like that
[03:57] <andrewarcade> Remember every Sunday to go to the Underground Walkway in Shibuya to get your smoothie that doesn't take up time!
[03:57] <andrewarcade> Also go to the flower shop, you can get plant nutrients!
[03:57] <andrewarcade> You can give it to your plant in your room every once in a while to increase kindness w/o passing time
[03:57] <andrewarcade> You can find jobs in the Underground Walkway in Shibya, at the magazine racks
[03:58] <@omegazeron> 4Head

[04:01] <@omegazeron> Black Knight challenge, third fight where he can fly
[04:02] <andrewarcade> Like the fast forward button works wonders in this game lol
[04:02] <@elyia_> you won't let me be a house wife, i had no choice
[04:02] <@omegazeron> There's 3 times you fight Black Knight in the normal game, so people call him Black Knight 3
[04:02] <@omegazeron> Black Knight 2 is skipped in speedrunning most of the time as well

[19:38] <leon_maxwell431> but still...would you try out Yakuza 0 for future streaming?
[19:38] <@jaystank> when you go to do like 2 blocks worth of mementos requests and all you hear is this music. forever. 4Head
[19:38] <leon_maxwell431> ...and in the farther future, Yakuza Kiwami, the remake of the PS2 version in August of 2017?
[19:41] <leon_maxwell431> Yakuza 0 is way better and way less cheezy than sleeping Dogs. you can run your own business, run hostess clubs, own other business, and fight a lot of thugs, other crime families, and all that goodness.
[19:42] <@jaystank> weeb theft auto? VoHiYo
[19:42] <andrewarcade> Yakuza is more like Shenmue than GTA
[19:42] <andrewarcade> Only... more violent OpieOP ;
[19:42] <andrewarcade> Er in regards to Shenmue that is lol
[19:42] <andrewarcade> No
[19:42] <stopperjj> Yakuza is a TON of story. It's pretty good, but a lot of story.
[19:42] <andrewarcade> Yakuza is action based
[19:43] <andrewarcade> It's very fun
[19:43] <andrewarcade> You'd like it AJ
[19:43] <@jaystank> the reaper VoHiYo
[19:43] <andrewarcade> Yeah you can stay in Momentos as long as you want to
[19:44] <andrewarcade> Would probably have to leave once you run out of SP though
[19:44] <@jaystank> as long as you change floors, it'll reset the reaper's spawn timer
[19:44] <andrewarcade> Oh yeah that too
[19:44] <andrewarcade> This random generated, looking for staircases is how most of the dungeons were like in Persona 4 btw AJ
[19:45] <andrewarcade> And then Persona 3 is basically almost all like this, just climbing the tower forever and ever NotLikeThis
[19:45] <@jaystank> mementos, the reverse tartarus
[19:45] <andrewarcade> P3 is still great

[04:14] <monstarrtv> snowball is a good medium ground between a crap mic and xlr condenser mic
[04:15] <monstarrtv> do you hear the game and your voice through your headphones?
[04:15] <@elyia_> ya at 10
[04:15] <stopperjj> For the money. The snowball is a great mic. No complaints.

[01:24] <gentlewings> i hated this fight, mostly bc im a dumbass
[01:24] <zorant0zero> This boss can be a long fight if you aren't careful
[01:24] <@actfast231> Each body part is draining different elements
[01:24] <@jaystank> every time you hear that robot sucking sound, it's healing
[01:24] <zorant0zero> When you hear that weird sound it means you are healing something

[01:28] <@jaystank> dr(ain)

[01:28] <@actfast231> @SimplyAJ Drain. It heals them when you attack them with it
[01:29] <@jaystank> times you would've died on merciless so far: 3... 4.
[01:30] <zorant0zero> I am doing merciless on my next playthrough @JayStank

[01:31] <@jaystank> merciless only. KevinTurtle
[01:31] <gentlewings> a god among men
[01:34] <@actfast231> You kinda have to kill them all around the same time. Rezzing/Healing bosses are always a pain in the ass
[01:34] <zorant0zero> This fight is easier with multi enemy targeting attacks.
[01:36] <@actfast231> Local teens and their cat hold up flamboyant old man. More at 11
[01:36] <@jaystank> certain body parts revive others, and it can only revive one per turn. you either kill them in the right order, or just stay ahead of the reviving.
[01:36] <gentlewings> 👏 👏👏
[01:37] <@jaystank> total times you would've died: 7 VoHiYo
[01:37] <@jaystank> that looked a lot easier on normal 4Head

[10:19] <andrewarcade> They reference characters from P3 and P4 in P5
[10:19] <@actfast231> They do?
[10:19] <andrewarcade> Yeah
[10:19] <andrewarcade> Yukari is interviewed on TV
[10:19] <andrewarcade> Naoto is mentioned in TV
[10:19] <@actfast231> Ooooh. I never pay attention to the TV lol
[10:19] <andrewarcade> Rise + Kanami have posted too :o
[10:19] <andrewarcade> lol AJ it's just like
[10:19] <gentlewings> aj asmr
[10:19] <andrewarcade> I TOLD YOU
[10:19] <andrewarcade> TO PLAY 4 FIRST
[10:20] <andrewarcade> YOU BUTTHEAD
[10:20] <ee_is_a_jim> get out of my ears
[10:20] <andrewarcade> claraLOL
[10:20] <andrewarcade> but TBH it doesn't matter
[10:20] <andrewarcade> you can play them in any order
[10:20] <andrewarcade> Persona 1 > Persona 2: Eternal Punishment> Persona 2: Innocent Sin > Persona 3 FES > Persona 4 Golden> Persona Q > Persona 5
[10:20] <andrewarcade> those are the flagship titles
[10:20] <andrewarcade> sans spin offs
[10:21] <andrewarcade> though
[10:21] <andrewarcade> Persona Q could be considered a spin off
[10:21] <@actfast231> But play Arena anyway cause it's a great fighting game ya nerd
[10:21] <@jaystank> mitsuru the fighting game? where we play mitsuru? and mitsuru? and sometimes aigis? but mostly mitsuru?
[10:22] <@actfast231> But Jay, I mained Yosuke Keepo
[10:22] <ee_is_a_jim> She a gold-digger
[10:22] <@jaystank> that doesn't sound like mitsuru to me
[10:22] <andrewarcade> But you're not missing anything too important reference-wise AJ. It's just a couple lines of text from the TV mentioning past characters really quickly just to link the games together.
[10:23] <gentlewings> i hope our boy is back in inaba by the time this is taking place
[10:23] <@jaystank> yOsuke, not yUsuke
[10:23] <illethal77> her cat has it pretty rough
[10:23] <andrewarcade> I just hope Koromaru is still ok FrankerZ

[10:24] <gentlewings> a friend
[10:25] <andrewarcade> Just gotta play P3 next OpieOP
[10:26] <andrewarcade> It's fine, just a few hundred hours worth of game play after this OpieOP
[10:26] <andrewarcade> Then New Game + for Persona 5, and then the other games to max out all the social links
[10:27] <andrewarcade> Hmm kind of
[10:27] <andrewarcade> You can get Persona 3 Portable on Playstation TV
[10:27] <andrewarcade> You can get Persona 3 FES on PSN on PS3
[10:27] <andrewarcade> Kind of different
[10:27] <andrewarcade> I mean
[10:27] <andrewarcade> It's the same game
[10:27] <andrewarcade> But because the PSP wasn't as strong as the PS2 they had to make a lot of places 2D
[10:27] <@actfast231> Persona 3 Portable is on PSP/VITA/TV, but it kiiiinda lacks animated cutscenes. And 3D environments outside Tartarus.
[10:27] <andrewarcade> And visual novel style
[10:28] <andrewarcade> But what's cool about P3P is there's 2 campaigns as a boy and girl, and they have different social links you can do
[10:28] <andrewarcade> Persona 3 FES is on PS3's PSN
[10:28] <andrewarcade> For like $10? I think
[10:28] <andrewarcade> Yeah It's $10 on PSN for PS3
[10:29] <andrewarcade> Also wow Catherine is on sale for $7 now on PSN
[10:29] <andrewarcade> Normally $20
[10:29] <ee_is_a_jim> Fire Emblem Sux Kappa
[10:29] <gentlewings> !lost
[10:29] <andrewarcade> Persona 3 was the initial release, Persona 3 FES is a re-release with new features + a new campaign
[10:30] <andrewarcade> Basically DLC before DLC lol
[10:30] <andrewarcade> It's like Persona 4 / Persona 4 Golden
[10:30] <andrewarcade> Yeah I'd recommend playing Persona 3 FES over Persona 3 Portable personally
[10:30] <andrewarcade> Not to say P3P was bad, it actually has some cool exclusive stuff with the Female MC
[10:31] <ee_is_a_jim> Well i have to go now, see ya later guys
[10:31] <@actfast231> It is, I think
[10:31] <andrewarcade> I think Persona 3 is going to trip you out and give you a potential confused boner with Yukari

[13:46] <stopperjj> 7 deadly sins is good. I enjoyed it.
01[13:46] <@asimplebot> /me
[13:46] <somniasalis> Why does Kaneshiro's shadow look nothing like him?
[13:46] <handlebar_orionx> What I can recommend is Gabriel DropOut. It's such a funny slice of life about fallen angels and demons trying to keep order in a human high school in Japan
[13:47] <somniasalis> His hair looks different too
[13:47] <handlebar_orionx> The joke being that the angels aren't that great and the demons are the most likable
03[13:47] * somniasalis (somniasalis@somniasalis.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[13:47] <brolteon> maybe in his mind he wants his guards to be scared of him

[13:50] <handlebar_orionx> Makoto's fighting stance looks like a paused dance pose
[13:50] <somniasalis> So what sins have we gone through?
[13:50] <@jaystank> lust, vanity, gluttony

03[13:51] * hxh_leorio (hxh_leorio@hxh_leorio.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[13:51] <handlebar_orionx> Makoto's stance must really hurt the shoulder blades if you stand like that for too long
[13:51] <naoto2shirogane> fear has a 90% chance to make a character stay still
[13:51] <somniasalis> @jaystank which 4 remain?

[13:52] <naoto2shirogane> lust?
[13:52] <brolteon> pride is vanity i beieve
[13:52] <naoto2shirogane> oh nvm
[13:53] <@jaystank> they separated vanity and pride for whatever reason
[13:53] <brolteon> o rly?
[13:53] <brolteon> so they skipped out on envy?
[13:53] <naoto2shirogane> guess so
[13:53] <handlebar_orionx> I tried Makoto's pose. That's a tight pull on the shoulder muscles. How does she stay so comfortable?
[13:54] <handlebar_orionx> It feels like putting yourself in a butterfly lock

[17:01] <quiverlip> I have like 3 hours free after school for whatever I want then most of the weekends

[17:09] <quiverlip> map system was somewhat rough at first because of how few there were
[17:09] <quiverlip> but I loved the gameplay
[17:09] <@actfast231> Splatoon Day 1 was about 23% of a full game. So it was slightly more done than Mass Effect Andromeda.
[17:09] <@actfast231> BOOM
[17:09] <quiverlip> I'll admit I grew to like it a lot more as time went on

[22:05] <quiverlip> Just been playing SFV all day
[22:05] <quiverlip> Online works pretty well now, at least on PS4
[22:06] <quiverlip> I wish SFV wasn't so expensive
[22:06] <quiverlip> Like sure you can earn characters
[22:06] <quiverlip> But it takes FOREVER
[22:06] <quiverlip> and season 2 is 20 bucks while season 3 is 30
[22:06] <quiverlip> Er season 1 and 3
[22:07] <quiverlip> I just wish there was a way to do a trial with the characters before buying them
[22:08] <quiverlip> Alright I guess I'll dip I don't want to ruin this game for myself because I really love it

[14:05] <@hotsammysliz> so whats persona all about. like i know the slice of life stuff but whats this mask on mask off stuff all about?
[14:06] <handlebar_orionx> The Emoji Movie crowd is basiclaly "omg y r ppl so mad? u dnt hav a since of humor (12,001 emoji that have nothing to do with the emotion they're expressing"

[14:07] <@hotsammysliz> thats cool
[14:08] <@hotsammysliz> nah it sounds cool. and makes sense with the slice of life stuff. to make you care about the chars
[14:08] <handlebar_orionx> I super wanna play Persona. Would I have to play every game before this one, or can I get into Persona 5 and not have any trouble figuring out the lore
[14:08] <handlebar_orionx> *?

[14:56] <handlebar_orionx> I figured out why I like the bass lines I like. They often use the three highest frequency cords
[14:58] <handlebar_orionx> For example, if you play bass right handed like most do, the two middle cords and the bottom most cord have that sweet audible kind of slappy sound heard in songs like The Seinfeld theme and Sweet Home Chicago
[14:58] <handlebar_orionx> I'm not great at music so I can't properly explain it.

[20:32] <@andrewarcade> You can only hang out with confiants to a certain date, basically when the game ends
[20:32] <@andrewarcade> But there's a couple that end earlier than that
[20:32] <@andrewarcade> Where you can't hang w/ them anymore
[20:33] <@andrewarcade> Just cause they're like busy with shit
[20:33] <@andrewarcade> Mishima and the Politician both can't hang again after like the middle of November
[20:33] <@andrewarcade> Well ok Mishima is kind of weird
[20:33] <ee_is_a_jim> BLESS U'
[20:33] <@andrewarcade> If you do a certain quest by November or not is what decides if you can hang with him or not
[20:33] <@andrewarcade> Yeah
[20:33] <@andrewarcade> I'm telling you for NG+
[20:33] <@andrewarcade> Because
[20:33] <@actfast231> Like on how his Confidant is handled, or just Mishima in general
[20:33] <@andrewarcade> I didn't know this lol
[20:33] <@andrewarcade> Well
[20:34] <@andrewarcade> If you don't do a certain mementos request by November
[20:34] <@andrewarcade> You can't hang out with him anymore
[20:34] <justdaid> somebody told me there is a must have confidant that you get in the third palace?
[20:34] <@andrewarcade> But if you do it, then you can still hang with him at a later date
[20:34] <justdaid> well during the 3rd
[20:34] <justdaid> sorry
[20:35] <justdaid> is it the one that lets you swap out people during battle?

[20:42] <@andrewarcade> I know there's only so many people you can max your first playthrough and I don't mean to back seat or anything. But Fortune Teller is great for NG+
[20:42] <@andrewarcade> and that's all shandShy

[20:43] <ee_is_a_jim> !wrath
[20:43] <@andrewarcade> The fortune teller lets you get relationship points without advancing time
[20:44] <@andrewarcade> Affinity readings can give you +3 notes assuming you have the persona of their arcana when you do the reading
[20:44] <@andrewarcade> Not RIGHT away
[20:44] <@andrewarcade> But at like rank 6-7 I think?
[20:44] <@actfast231> Shit, I really wish I had known that in my first playthrough
[20:44] <@andrewarcade> ok so
[20:44] <@andrewarcade> let's say
[20:44] <@andrewarcade> you go for Ann
[20:45] <@andrewarcade> You make sure you have Lovers persona when doing affinity reading
[20:45] <@andrewarcade> To get the most out of the reading
[20:45] <@andrewarcade> Or if you go for Ryuji, you get chariot
[20:45] <@andrewarcade> Or Makoto you get priestess
[20:45] <@andrewarcade> etc. etc.
[20:45] <@andrewarcade> Every single day you can get affinity readings
[20:45] <@andrewarcade> For 5,000 yen
[20:46] <@andrewarcade> With any of your confiants
[20:46] <@andrewarcade> confidants*
[20:46] <@andrewarcade> But see in NG+ if you maxed out the fortune teller, you get access to affinity readings right at Rank 1 with her.
[20:46] <@andrewarcade> So you max out confidants left and right quick
[20:46] <@andrewarcade> Nah, you get her to rank 6 or 7 to get affinity readings
[20:47] <@actfast231> I feel like I didn't max any of the super useful confidants in my first run. Outside of the doctor, gun vendor, and Mishima brownRIP

[23:51] <@gamedragonx> although I've only known her for a palace and a half, and all of the story fluff inbetween
[23:52] <@actfast231> She's your new Navigator, replacing Morgana
[23:52] <@gamedragonx> she does stuff and things. Man I need to get to Mementos and confuse a boss. I too, need stacks
[23:52] <@gamedragonx> I'm in a constant state of broke
[23:54] <@gamedragonx> yeah I have the teacher's mementos request open now. I was just waiting until I get a few more
[23:54] <@gamedragonx> maybe after I finish this current palace
[23:55] <@gamedragonx> what level are you? I think I was in the low 30s
[23:55] <@gamedragonx> jeez
[23:55] <@gamedragonx> I just hit 38 in my game

[23:56] <@gamedragonx> I literally fight every monster in dungeons
[23:56] <@gamedragonx> but I haven't gone into mementos that often
[23:56] <@actfast231> Well you also level grind a bit.
[23:56] <@gamedragonx> Anubis were annoying
[23:57] <@gamedragonx> ever since I got the one Persona that is null to gunfire and weapons I haven't had a game over. I usually can manage enough with the squad
[23:57] <@gamedragonx> he's ugly AF but man is he useful
[23:57] <@actfast231> Oh yeah, doing all the requests is another trophy best done in NG+

[00:00] <@gamedragonx> I like Isis too
[00:00] <@actfast231> I never bothered with Hama or Mudo skills, because one hit kill moves are SP drains and have no effect on bosses.
[00:01] <@gamedragonx> you go talk to the bar
[00:01] <@andrewarcade> no prob
[00:01] <@gamedragonx> so you'd have to wait until night

01[00:02] <@asimplebot> /me
[00:02] <@actfast231> We back boyz
[00:02] <@gamedragonx> I remember that you need certain levels of something to work at the bar
[00:02] <@gamedragonx> I think it was kindness and proficiency?
[00:02] <@gamedragonx> I forget
[00:02] <@gamedragonx> it'll tell you
[00:03] <@gamedragonx> my wife though
[00:03] <@gamedragonx> I spent so much time trying to wrap it up that I have 10 days left for the current palace and it gave me like 24

[00:08] <@elyia_> bawkGrump
[00:08] <@gamedragonx> worked out? didn't even know that was a thing lol
[00:08] <@elyia_> I'm back
[00:08] <@gamedragonx> Hey Ely
[00:08] <@elyia_> hello Keith
[00:09] <@gamedragonx> HP? the hell I need with more HP
[00:09] <@gamedragonx> what I needed were the SP Bandages 3 I got for my whole squad. That's what I needed
[00:10] <@gamedragonx> you were gonna show your stats?
[00:11] <@gamedragonx> WutFace
[00:12] <@gamedragonx> lol those stats are indeed garbage. Do you do stat activities?
03[00:12] * 47y_mc (47y_mc@47y_mc.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[00:12] <@gamedragonx> like bathhouse for charm, burger eating contest for guts, studying in the diner for more knowledge, etc?
[00:14] <@gamedragonx> ah ok. Yeah I've been doing stuff like that the entire time based on what stat I needed to unlock more confidant stuff
[00:14] <@gamedragonx> like I started spamming the burger contest when I found out I needed guts for Iwai
[00:14] <@gamedragonx> then I started getting Knowledge and charm to talk to Makoto and Takemi
[00:15] <@gamedragonx> I was like "oh crap I need this level? go do all the things"
[00:15] <@gamedragonx> yeah the bathhouse gives you charm, or eating at the maid cafe
[00:15] <@gamedragonx> bath house gives more charm on Mondays and Thursdays. Even more if its raining
[00:17] <@gamedragonx> I would say just start building all of your stats. You'll need charm to finish Takemi. One of Makoto's later levels takes level 4 charm
[00:17] <@gamedragonx> you'll need proficiency and kindness to eventually do Futaba stuff
[00:17] <@actfast231> If you call your teacher in to do shit, the cafe closes and everyone leaves, Sojiro included @SimplyAJ
[00:18] <@gamedragonx> the only good kindness thing Ive found is working the job at the flower shop, honestly
[00:19] <@gamedragonx> I never did get a plant lol
[00:20] <@gamedragonx> man I cared 0% about Ann and Ryuji. I think they're both level 2
[00:20] <@gamedragonx> I like Sasuke and waifu better
[00:21] <@gamedragonx> Sasuke, Waifu, and Morgana
[00:21] <@gamedragonx> I got him enough confidant just to get baton pass, but I haven't really got his level that high either
[00:22] <@gamedragonx> I call him Sasuke. Dunno why but it just made sense at the time
[00:22] <@gamedragonx> damn, that is the monkey king alright
[00:22] <@actfast231> It's good to get party members up because their later abilities allow for saved negotiations, enduring lethal hits, and even blocking lethal damage to the protag.
[00:22] <@actfast231> That and Persona evolution
03[00:23] * 47y_mc (47y_mc@47y_mc.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[00:23] <@gamedragonx> yeah I'll probably get Sasuke up but I really wanted to get the support characters maxed like Teacher and clinic
[00:23] <justdaid> Sasuke is the dark and brooding one from Naruto
[00:23] <@actfast231> Who's Sasuke?
[00:23] <@gamedragonx> it got uglier
[00:23] <@gamedragonx> Sasuke = Yusuke
[00:24] <@actfast231> Aaah
[00:24] <@gamedragonx> but yeah, after I get Teacher to max I'll work on him, if I still have time
[00:24] <@gamedragonx> its like October 1st in my game
[00:25] <@gamedragonx> I might already know one of them, because I haven't seem them in a while
[00:25] <@gamedragonx> but yeah, you can let me know
[00:25] <@gamedragonx> we must shit talk baseball at all times
[00:26] <@gamedragonx> yeah Mishima I haven't seen him in a while already. I didn't even start the politician stuff

[00:27] <andrewarcade> lol
[00:27] <@gamedragonx> so what date does the game end? Just so I get an idea of how far I have to go
[00:27] <andrewarcade> bye bye ryuji
[00:27] <andrewarcade> what
[00:27] <andrewarcade> Oh yeah
[00:27] <andrewarcade> If you don't do a certain quest of Mishima by November, then you can't max him in December

[00:28] <@gamedragonx> go talk to the bar and see what stats you need
[00:28] <@gamedragonx> just so you know
[00:28] <@gamedragonx> because I don't remember
[00:29] <justdaid> dong you have to pick up a flyer first?
[00:29] <@gamedragonx> do you?
[00:29] <@gamedragonx> if I did I didn't remember picking up said flyer
[00:29] <@actfast231> You should be able to. Maybe go get a flyer or something from the job rack
[00:30] <justdaid> huh
[00:32] <@gamedragonx> lol I love the random "oh shit I don't have an umbrella"
[00:32] <@gamedragonx> nah its closed in the day
[00:32] <@gamedragonx> normally you would be able to apply when its open at night. maybe there's some other trigger you have to do first that no one remembers
[00:33] <@actfast231> So somebody tried to spend $55 on my debit card at a fast food joint in Miami Florida
[00:33] <@gamedragonx> maybe its an automatic trigger? I didn't even try to apply until like September tbh
[00:33] <@actfast231> brownRIP my debit card
[00:33] <@gamedragonx> 55 at a fast food place? they trying to feast on McDoubles
[00:34] <@andrewarcade> whoa that's nuts actfast
[00:34] <@actfast231> Things just aren't going my way lately
[00:34] <@gamedragonx> rough stuff
[00:35] <@gamedragonx> handiness? what are these japanese translations
[00:35] <@gamedragonx> oh thats why you cant apply then, you didn't start Ohya

[00:37] <@gamedragonx> Ohya with her gogo dancer lookin' ass

[00:51] <@gamedragonx> one takes level 4 and the other is level 5
[00:51] <@gamedragonx> also I was kinda sad I got level 4 guts because Iwai's stuff I didn't care about at all

[01:03] <@gamedragonx> or bathe for charm or call teacher since its Friday

The thumb safety is extended to make it easier on the finger. A long-type trigger with non-slip grooves. A ring hammer...The base of the trigger guard's been filed down for a higher grip. And not only that, nearly every part of this gun has been expertly crafted and customized. Where'd you get something like this?

[16:24] <rchilds515> its set during the time that he disappears to "take care of some things" so his levels and gear are like it would be if you progressed straight through to that point i think
[16:26] <rchilds515> you carry over some new skills and a weapon i think. but the weapon is rubbish if you've beat the game
[16:27] <rchilds515> its mostly fill in the story. the fighting mechanics are a bit different and thats fun. plus Marshal Cor tags along for a bit in the dungeon and he's a badass in action

[16:33] <rchilds515> that's fair. I've read the book its based on and really enjoy the story. plus the Romance of the Three Kingdom games are nice if you like strategy/empire building types

[16:53] <justdaid> so I looked up the laws cause that is what old dad types do... Age of consent in Japan is 13 so Moe and Teacher is okay but a bit taboo because its his teacher... There are also no direct child pornography laws in Japan. Also any picture that does not expose genitals is not considered obscene or promiscuous... so Futaba could pose mostly nude at any age and it would be okay

[17:39] <@actfast231> Actually, Kindness was REALLY close to Max. Cause I maxed it nearly instantly in NG+
[17:40] <@actfast231> I think the last day you have to actually increase social stats is like... somewhere in late December.
[17:40] <@actfast231> Cause I know the final boss in the true ending is fought on Christmas Eve

[02:33] <notbutterfree_bird> He always said he wanted to meet James Rolfe and there's a possibility he'll be at Portland Retro Gaming Expo like other years he's been there and I'm usually the one who's a guide to who's who.

[02:35] <notbutterfree_bird> It all depends on what's happening in october. I really do want to go to magfest though.
[02:35] <cha0tiktvgaming> At work, editing videos for the week for YouTube.
[02:36] <cha0tiktvgaming> I'm going to start over actually. Now that the embargo isn't a think I want to start fresh and record the entire experience since it's a long ass game.
[02:36] <cha0tiktvgaming> isn't a thing*
[02:36] <notbutterfree_bird> Only another month until I can play Crash Bandicoot in glorious HD.
[02:36] <cha0tiktvgaming> ^ can't wait either
[02:36] <cha0tiktvgaming> lol I didn't play the first one
[02:37] <cha0tiktvgaming> Did you see my video on my Sony E3 predictions?!

[02:41] <notbutterfree_bird> I'm selling my ps4 to my friend once I get my hands on the blue Dragon Quest ps4 and DQ11.
[02:42] <cha0tiktvgaming> I can't wait for MHXX Switch. Hopefully it comes to the US
[02:43] <notbutterfree_bird> Not as far as I know, but it's released in july for japan since we know localization is a b**ch for US.

[02:55] <@gamedragonx> refer to previous statement of not being able to sleep. I think playing Persona all day stuck my brain to "On"
[02:56] <@gamedragonx> yeah its very odd
[02:56] <@gamedragonx> this game is a time warp like fighting games and MMOs
[02:56] <@jaystank> VoHiYo
[02:57] <@gamedragonx> Diddy Kong. In my defense, I would've left it at as the original name but they erased it and it was too long
[02:58] <@gamedragonx> but yeah, right now I'm on the 7th palace. which somehow is even more annoying than the 6th palace was WutFace
[02:59] <@gamedragonx> Okomura is 5
[02:59] <@gamedragonx> I didn't really think his was that annoying. just big
[03:00] <@gamedragonx> well, that and big bang attack. that was annoying
[03:00] <notbutterfree_bird> Well I'm taking a look at japanese star wars trading cards.
[03:01] <@gamedragonx> Kamoshida was definitely the weirdest boss. Dude out here drinking people
[03:02] <notbutterfree_bird> http://ws-tcg.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/today_card/20170531_13.png
[03:02] <notbutterfree_bird> Only problem is it's not legal to play in any tournament.
[03:04] <notbutterfree_bird> So the booster set will cover the original trilogy and force awakens. No prequel trilogy in sight.
[03:04] <@gamedragonx> my poor wife, I have to see her not get wifed up in this playthrough
[03:04] <@gamedragonx> damn shame
[03:05] <notbutterfree_bird> It's specifically made to be a collector's item because english territories aren't getting it. I would bet licensing rights would be hell.

[03:07] <cha0tiktvgaming> Okay, this weekend if you have it :)
[03:07] <@gamedragonx> Tekken is going to be hype
[03:08] <cha0tiktvgaming> I know right! I'm so ready!
[03:08] <ryushura> @GameDragonX whats good man
[03:08] <@gamedragonx> HeyGuys
[03:08] <ryushura> anyone who picks akuma is on my hit list
[03:08] <cha0tiktvgaming> I've played every Tekken starting with 2
[03:09] <cha0tiktvgaming> Yeah, I remember that. What about it?
[03:09] <cha0tiktvgaming> I'm sure they will even if it's patching involved
[03:09] <@gamedragonx> Tekken has a lot of silly costumes
[03:09] <notbutterfree_bird> In the game, some cards allow you to play as many as you want which we would call an army type of card. And stormtroopers only can be a thing with a negative effect that reflects the fact that they can't shoot.
[03:09] <@gamedragonx> dunno if you have been watching the greentekken arcade videos
[03:09] <@gamedragonx> but its as ridiculous as usual

[03:23] <@gamedragonx> Marduk is not back, but he's essentially been replaced by Gigas
[03:23] <@gamedragonx> a different grappler
[03:24] <@gamedragonx> Gigas and Marduk have a lot of similar moves, to the point that the internet is actually wondering if Gigas is Marduk after some sort of experiment
[03:25] <@gamedragonx> a hot mess
[03:26] <cha0tiktvgaming> I hated this game though
[03:26] <@gamedragonx> the originally SFxT trailer. I liked it
[03:26] <cha0tiktvgaming> Trailer was dope
[03:26] <@gamedragonx> the game itself was kinda meh at launch, but got exponentially better with the 2013 patch
[03:26] <cha0tiktvgaming> I was just bad at it lol
[03:27] <cha0tiktvgaming> Oh I didn't play it after release month
[03:27] <notbutterfree_bird> Speaking of which, anyone remember that Tekken x Street Fighter was supposed to be a thing?
[03:27] <@gamedragonx> it probably will be eventually
[03:28] <cha0tiktvgaming> lol
[03:29] <@gamedragonx> Akuma is also in it for story reasons which somehow makes perfect sense
[03:30] <@gamedragonx> nah SFxT has auto combos but like a lot of games with auto combos (P4A) they are nowhere near optimal damage
[03:30] <@gamedragonx> the good stuff was hard
[03:31] <@gamedragonx> funny enough, Jehta is rumored to be in MvCi in the latest leak list
[03:31] <@gamedragonx> yeah boys and girls, its THAT time of year NotLikeThis
[03:32] <notbutterfree_bird> Potential leak for MvCi said that a monster hunter in rathalos armor could be in.
[03:33] <@gamedragonx> I mean, licensing is indeed a bitch
[03:33] <@gamedragonx> spills over to the games too
[03:33] <notbutterfree_bird> Let's blame disney for that this time.
[03:34] <@gamedragonx> licensing is the reason why, for a period of time, you couldn't even buy the DLC characters in MvC3
[03:34] <@gamedragonx> you and every comic fan on the planet feels the same way lol
[03:35] <@gamedragonx> if I don't get Incredibles world someone is catching hands

[03:14] <gentlewings> im hoping for sinnoh remakes still... never give up...
[03:14] <notbutterfree_bird> Hopefully Sony shows us something good within the next year.
[03:14] <gentlewings> but yeah i was mainly wanting kh3 news too
03[03:15] * milkyjuice (milkyjuice@milkyjuice.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[03:15] <cha0tiktvgaming> I'm going to tell you Sony has some shit ready for us. So far all of my predictions have been correct.
[03:15] <cha0tiktvgaming> I'm excited to see what Sony does.
[03:15] <xbrcat> more info of last of us 2, Spiderman, god of war, and Nintendo announce a metroid
[03:15] <xbrcat> game
[03:16] <justdaid> a lot of the voice acting and mocap stuff is done for last of us 2
[03:16] <notbutterfree_bird> The day frickin Bubsy got a new game before Metroid did.
[03:16] <justdaid> when that means we will get a game I dont know... but a lot of the background practical stuff is done
[03:16] <xbrcat> so true @notbutterfree_bird
[03:17] <cha0tiktvgaming> Sony: KH3, FF7R, Dissidia (Two of those already announced), Last of US 2, Spider-Man, DragonBall Fighters, Detroit, Resident Evil 2... I could go on.Microsoft: I just want to see Scorpio and if they will actually release games I care about.Nintendo: THEY BETTER ANNOUNCE A REAL FUCKIN POKEMON GAME
[03:17] <notbutterfree_bird> I suppose we can blame Sonic Forces for that.
[03:17] <justdaid> its 30 min... that is all you are going to get
[03:17] <gentlewings> oh jeez haha ultra sun and moon... wasnt expecting that at all
[03:18] <cha0tiktvgaming> ^ That pissed me off
[03:18] <justdaid> why?
[03:19] <cha0tiktvgaming> They released that shitty Pokemon fighter again on Switch then released the real games again on 3DS
[03:19] <justdaid> why would they ever put a pokemon game on the Switch?!?? If Nintendo was going to put a pokemon game on a major console they would have done it on the Wii
[03:20] <gentlewings> i wouldve been happier about gold/silver if they were releasing crystal too tbh

[03:24] <notbutterfree_bird> Yeah I finished the game, but sun and moon did feel underwhelming even though I may have liked the whole idea of it now that I actually experienced Hawaii.
[03:24] <cha0tiktvgaming> @justDaid It's both a development issue and hardware limitations. The device most likely is at it's PEAK handling games like Pokemon and Bravely default.

[03:25] <@actfast231> My E3 predictions? Sorry, my stream lagged before you finished talking
[03:25] <@actfast231> And it still kinda is because my internet is trash
[03:25] <justdaid> The only limitations that exist in the handheld line are those built into it.
[03:25] <justdaid> yes ActFast231 he asked about your e3 predictions
[03:26] <@actfast231> Holy fuck, Twitch is actually breaking for me? Like, massive audio lag, screen whiting out, stuttering. Fucking hellfire why??
[03:26] <@actfast231> I think it's stable now
[03:27] <justdaid> Game Freak is not Nintendo... Game Freak is own by Nintendo but they are a separate companies... While GF should and probably does have extra connections they still operate somewhat separately from Nintendo

[14:12] <kinako78> Good question. Why can't you?
[14:13] <kinako78> Oh, wait. He probably wouldn't complain about the hoodie after having to wear that getup in the Velvet Room.
[14:14] <kinako78> Don't jinx it!
[14:15] <kinako78> Because he's looking at a Shadow version of himself, maybe?

[15:07] <arpeeph> how is your social links?
[15:07] <arpeeph> and ur leve?
[15:07] <kinako78> Well, fair enough. Haru shows up really late in the game for you to get attached to her.
[15:07] <arpeeph> how many are max?
[15:07] <kinako78> She's definitely my least favorite.
[15:07] <kinako78> Yeah, that, too. She's too nice/sweet
[15:07] <@jaystank> she's a cardboard cutout of a forehead MingLee
[15:08] <kinako78> I can only recall one moment where she actually got angry and it was a good moment.
[15:09] <@jaystank> small paper man #59
[15:09] <kinako78> Yeah, that's the moment I mean. It was the only time she showed any real character.
[15:10] <kinako78> Cause, yeah, when we see her dad's death live on TV, I think I seriously expected her to have trust issues with the rest of the group.

[15:12] <kinako78> We were supposed to have Hifumi as a party member, but I think her traits ended up making part of Makoto's character.
[15:13] <kinako78> I forgot why they ended up not making Hifumi a party member. I think it was time constraints or something.
[15:14] <kinako78> We were also supposed to originally be staying in the same apartment building as Sae and Makoto.
[15:14] <kinako78> Although I think staying with Sojiro really was better in the end.
[15:15] <kinako78> Oh, yeah, I think this is where I stopped on Futaba's social link last time.
[15:16] <kinako78> I just did not make time for my social links very well. As far as the non-story driven ones, I only finished Ryuji's and Takemi's.

[15:39] <@elyia_> yes
[15:40] <rchilds515> the theory is kind of a walk through of the dungeon so you don't need to fully go through it. I haven't gone all the way through either

[15:40] <@elyia_> what makes you think I wanna get a stupid theme like 90% of the section

[16:27] <warriorsfan92> I also went to see a "Doctor" about my negative wording of things all the time

[16:30] <warriorsfan92> But Metroid 2 will be my most played game after I spend a week or 6 on Sonic Mania
[16:31] <warriorsfan92> Well actually I'll reword it to sound better, I don't like Kingdom Hearts at all, so when I saw the trailer I was like, ehh
[16:31] <chriscella> Yeah its been Calabazals idea, and i known him for a long time, so i wouldnt dare say no xD
[16:31] <warriorsfan92> Looks better than Call of Duty at least
[16:32] <warriorsfan92> Wolfenstein just looks, weirder than usual
[16:32] <chriscella> Also, smooool question, the butler/maid outfits arent in the store yet on EU, where did you get them?

[16:39] <chriscella> i bought Destiny with its expansions. But yeh, its not my kinda game, dropped at lvl 9^^
[16:39] <warriorsfan92> I also want Mother 3 port like every other nerd who thinks it's a possibility even though it really isn't
[16:39] <chriscella> *on sale ofc
[16:39] <warriorsfan92> What I don't want is for Nintendo to cave and make Smash Melee instead of Smash 4 Deluxe
[16:40] <warriorsfan92> It looks like Smash Melee Stans will win out though based on what I've seen
[16:40] <chriscella> i WOULD play it on pc with Mouse and keyboard though, albeit not competitive , but story atleast
[16:40] <chriscella> what little story there is^^
[16:41] <warriorsfan92> Destiny has better lore than Dark Souls at least
[16:41] <warriorsfan92> Which isn't saying much, but still
[16:41] <venomoustoast> PogChamp

[16:45] <warriorsfan92> That was a big announcement
[16:45] <@jaystank> yeah, i want to see actual in-game shit. i don't want to get hip-checked half way across the map MingLee
[16:46] <warriorsfan92> At least Skyrims Durability system isn't garbage
[16:47] <warriorsfan92> Breath of the Wild 2 better not have them there breakin weapons

[16:48] <warriorsfan92> Well I mean they'll never go back from BOTW style
[16:49] <warriorsfan92> Once you open up the Sandbox Pandoras Box upon gamers, going back to something with an actual plot structure would cause the internet to have a stroke
[16:49] <rchilds515> since you were talking about wanting to play FFXV again have you heard about the update by end of June that will put in an Off Road Regalia
[16:49] <warriorsfan92> Gamers today increasingly want to do everything their own way instead of playing a unique game
[16:49] <@jaystank> that's never stopped nintendo before OpieOP
[16:49] <ee_is_a_jim> Nintendo went allout this year
[16:49] <@elyia_> I told mom I'm leaving her
[16:50] <ee_is_a_jim> 3 new Mario games, 2 new metroid, kirby, yoshi, hype
[16:50] <warriorsfan92> They didn't change the OOT style until on console ever
[16:50] <warriorsfan92> Until BOTW

[16:50] <@elyia_> that's what I meant
[16:51] <warriorsfan92> Every 3D Zelda game followed the same formula
[16:51] <warriorsfan92> Do the dungeons in a specific order
[16:51] <warriorsfan92> That's the big one
[16:51] <ee_is_a_jim> now if you'll excuse me I'm gonna practice onlimar on smash 3ds Kappa
[16:51] <@simplyaj> Zelda 1 didn't follow that order. Neither did Link to the past nor Link between worlds 4Head
01[16:51] <@asimplebot> /me
[16:52] <warriorsfan92> I said every 3D one
[16:52] <warriorsfan92> And Link Between Worlds now seems like BOTW Patient Zero

[17:49] <warriorsfan92> 2 and 3 introduced too many different styles of gameplay for me
[17:49] <@omegazeron> Yeah that's what I was thinking, I agree with Mirby, Nintendo is closely overseeing it, and the trailer looked fucking amazing
[17:49] <warriorsfan92> 1 kept it down to the nitty gritty essentials

[04:40] <justdaid> I dont think MHW is going to be better than XX, it will be different and it will be on a machine with better graphics... but that does not mean it will be a better game
[04:40] <gentlewings> what command would be better here, !baby or !lost
[04:41] <ryushura> i cant wait to have the ps4 the more i think about it the more i want it here

[04:42] <justdaid> no, I think you need to put 100+ more hours into it
[04:42] <ryushura> # give Midna some rootbeer
[04:43] <ryushura> what do u all think about dragonball fighters z when i saw that game all i could think of is take all my money plz
[04:44] <ryushura> this is going to be my number 2 game i get on the ps4
[04:44] <justdaid> Persona 5 or DBZ?
[04:45] <ryushura> DBZ
[04:46] <ryushura> A fucking man aj more people need to listen to this
[04:47] <justdaid> that is all XX is...
[04:47] <ryushura> so many people are loseing there shit over the voice acting

[04:47] <justdaid> I am excited for the upgrade
[04:48] <ryushura> i have friends who have never played a mh game befor called me saying u need to buy a ps4 and get mhw
[04:48] <justdaid> I always get a bit salty after a game changes consoles lines
[04:48] <justdaid> its one of the reasons I am frustrated with the KH line
[04:49] <justdaid> Some people buy consoles because of a certain game though
[04:49] <justdaid> Sometimes dev companies cannot get cross play
[04:50] <justdaid> Rocket League gets cross play because they maintain their own servers
[04:50] <justdaid> Capcom uses Nintendo servers I thought?
[04:51] <justdaid> well soon to be PS4 servers
[04:51] <justdaid> is it confirmed they are getting their own dedicated?
[04:51] <justdaid> if so then yeah they should be able to cross play

[04:54] <gentlewings> omg?!
[04:54] <ryushura> im so done playing gen that game got so bad now when u play online its like nothing but 24/7 dreadking hunts
[04:55] <justdaid> like how 4u turned into nothing but 140 Rajang hunts?
[04:55] <gentlewings> nice catch, dude
[04:55] <ryushura> yup
[04:55] <justdaid> 3U was the last MH to my knowledge that had variety at end game
[04:56] <justdaid> They are trying to create an "end game" but its not working out so far

[09:15] <@jaystank> fusion accident TehePelo
[09:16] <jacklockjaw> Because it was like 100 gameplay hours ago
[09:16] <@jaystank> the very beginning of the game. it was also garbled
[09:17] <@jaystank> and this is something you wouldn't see coming unless you had played previous games Jebaited
[09:17] <jacklockjaw> Because you would have no other frame of reference for Igor
[09:17] <@jaystank> igor is the one who always fuses the personas, not your attendants
[09:18] <@actfast231> This Igor behaved somewhat differently than the 'real' Igor
[09:19] <jacklockjaw> I remember how jarred I was by his voice when I started this game
[09:19] <@jaystank> this igor talked a lot more shit. and also referred to the velvet room as "his" velvet room, rather than "the" velvet room
[09:20] <@actfast231> Take that deal if you want the bad ending
[09:20] <@jaystank> SUPER obvious Jebaited
[09:21] <jacklockjaw> A great deal - a tremendous deal.
[09:21] <@jaystank> and then the fall occurred as planned, and nobody remembered anything. the end.
[09:22] <@actfast231> And suddenly child organ trafficing
[09:22] <@jaystank> akechi somehow shows up, shoots you in the face
[09:23] <@actfast231> Sooo... is your party dead/gone in this ending? That's... morbid as fuck.

[09:27] <@jaystank> he always looks that evil
[09:27] <jacklockjaw> He looks exactly the same
[09:27] <@actfast231> It was easier to predict with past experience, yes
[09:28] <@jaystank> i KNEW when i realized "wait, igor isn't fusing my personas"
[09:28] <@jaystank> which was... around futaba's palace?
[09:28] <jacklockjaw> He's suspicious for sure, but it could have also just been a change in voice actor/style for the game, too. It's not a dead give away, but it makes you wonder.
[09:28] <@actfast231> Yeah, the fact that Caroline and Justine do the fusions rather than Igor himself is REAL fucking suspicious

[09:48] <chriscella> Didnt the original VA die?
[09:49] <chriscella> or was that someone else...
[09:49] <@actfast231> Japanese VA died, English VA still kicking
[09:49] <chriscella> oh right
[09:49] <@jaystank> they probably didn't bring him on, so they re-used the SIU director's voice actor
[09:49] <@jaystank> since he has such a small part in the story this time

[15:46] <jacklockjaw> I didn't catch the pancakes thing. What made me suspect him was that his social link was an automatic one.
[15:46] <@elyia_> cause he had to leave
[15:47] <@elyia_> they were sad about it
[15:47] <@elyia_> doesnt mean the separation isnt sad
[15:48] <jacklockjaw> His thing just progressed with the story's progression. You never hang out with him. Which to me, from my persona experience, means that his whole story is too closely tied to the story and not through player choice.
[15:48] <jacklockjaw> It sucks, but sometimes familiarity with game mechanics can kind of be spoilery.

[20:32] <@gamedragonx> also wow, you really botched that one
[20:32] <geekmostrandom> He needs a hug STAT
[20:32] <@gamedragonx> sidestep, jump
[20:32] <@gamedragonx> you may have even been able to hit him since he was on magic pixel
[20:33] <@gamedragonx> if there is one thing this game did, it was make me very confident for the eventual Tekken x Street Fighter
[20:33] <@gamedragonx> because akuma was done very well. And Eliza might as well be a SF character with how she controls
[20:35] <@gamedragonx> well, at least you finished P5 so you're free to play other stuff
[20:35] <@gamedragonx> I'm happy to be free so I can play all of these fighting games I can't even hold at once
[20:36] <@gamedragonx> he's as insane as Oni Akuma DLC fight on Asura's Wrath
[20:37] <@gamedragonx> nah, earlier I said: P5 ending was cool. I felt the warm embrace of squadship
[20:37] <@gamedragonx> I think I had 106 hours
[20:39] <@gamedragonx> you know what you don't do? that slow ass attack you tried to do
[20:40] <@gamedragonx> oh, it looks like you have to rage art
[20:40] <@gamedragonx> so if you haven't changed your controls, hit RB
[20:40] <@gamedragonx> at that time
[20:40] <@gamedragonx> right button
[20:40] <@jaystank> rb should be r1
[20:41] <geekmostrandom> R1
[20:41] <@gamedragonx> RB = Right Button, RT = Right Trigger
[20:42] <@gamedragonx> that moment only

[20:50] <@gamedragonx> not only do you not buy the Rainmaker outfit
[20:50] <@gamedragonx> but you make a character from Hatoful Boyfriend
[20:50] <justdaid> oh god, now Sammy will want to play this game
[20:51] <@jaystank> the king of all pigeons
[20:51] <@gamedragonx> they should've made Rainmaker King a default option on all consoles
[20:51] <@gamedragonx> instead I have to go buy it on every single console I come in contact with NotLikeThis
[20:51] <@elyia_> it was good
[20:52] <@gamedragonx> so backstory, King has 3 pieces of equpiment that he can wear at once that if he does, it changes his rage art entirely
[20:52] <@gamedragonx> I think he's the only one
[20:53] <@gamedragonx> yeah that's Rainmaker King
[20:53] <@gamedragonx> which is why I wish they just put it on all consoles at default

[21:29] <inah8bit> Ahaha, just arcade stuff put into consoles.
[21:29] <inah8bit> you can put them on screen AJ
[21:29] <inah8bit> press Triangle
[21:29] <inah8bit> and then do Select + R1 to scroll through them.
[21:30] <inah8bit> down square triangle to get out of it.

[21:33] <@gamedragonx> they keep it universal
[21:33] <inah8bit> yeah.
[21:33] <@gamedragonx> which makes perfect sense actually
[21:33] <inah8bit> Cause people who talk about it in social media or forums share combos and they may not be on the same platform.
[21:33] <@gamedragonx> it would be really annoying if they didnt when discussing the game with anybody lol
[21:33] <inah8bit> Nobody wants to deal with qcf Square qcb triangle
[21:34] <inah8bit> when everyone else who played the game always have done
[21:34] <inah8bit> 236A 236B or something.
[21:34] <@gamedragonx> PC player would slap the shit out of me if I told them to punish with down back square
[21:34] <inah8bit> SNK have done this for the longest time. haha.
[21:34] <inah8bit> like how Tekken is 1234 for face buttons.
[21:35] <@gamedragonx> if its stuff thats only one console, like say smash, then its fine
[21:35] <inah8bit> only console you say? Street Fighter 5? Keepo Kappa
03[21:35] * siegelife (siegelife@siegelife.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[21:35] <@gamedragonx> but anything thats multi console it is much easier to use universal lingo
[21:35] <inah8bit> that's a punch counter
[21:35] <@gamedragonx> PC version probably better than PS4 version tbh
[21:35] <inah8bit> if you get punched during that her head falls off and you can punish.
[21:36] <@gamedragonx> PC versions usually have less input lag
[21:36] <inah8bit> for street fighter? isn't it because its cross platform anyway?
[21:36] <@gamedragonx> they also, at least lately, run smoother
[21:36] <inah8bit> yeah, cause it just runs better

[21:37] <@gamedragonx> sometimes the netcode is better, like PC and PS4 Tekken
[21:37] <@gamedragonx> just varies from release to release
[21:37] <xbrcat> i got street fight 2 on switch. its fun, but at the end of the day its just another port.
03[21:37] * piratera (piratera@piratera.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[21:38] <@gamedragonx> anyway, Tekken is a great game and I'm going ham sandwich in it
[21:38] <inah8bit> I think netcode for PS4 and PC are just the sameee..
[21:38] <xbrcat> sf 2 on switch it has like a mini game where you play as ryu in the pov and you have to use motion controls to use his special moves. its fun
[21:38] <@gamedragonx> well I guess I shouldn't say netcode, I should say ability to connect for matches
[21:39] <inah8bit> its just that Console players have more wifi warriors than PC> LUL
[21:39] <@gamedragonx> which just gets kinda lumped in with netcode
[21:39] <@gamedragonx> that's also true
[21:39] <inah8bit> Yeah consoles got that issue first week of release
[21:39] <inah8bit> How is it now?
[21:39] <@gamedragonx> these wack ass internets
[21:39] <@gamedragonx> its better now
[21:39] <inah8bit> on PC i still get the "Cannot connect to opponent"
[21:39] <inah8bit> oh man

[21:40] <@gamedragonx> Tekken is hard but it's fair, like a parent
[21:40] <inah8bit> I still can't get out of green ranks though.
[21:40] <@gamedragonx> I don't know the colors
[21:40] <inah8bit> its just after uhh
[21:40] <inah8bit> the Initiate Line
[21:41] <inah8bit> the solid blue rectangle rank
[21:41] <@gamedragonx> oh, haven't gotten that far yet. Still on 3rd Dan
[21:41] <inah8bit> yeah, after 3rd dan is the initiate line
[21:41] <inah8bit> then Green ranks
[21:41] <@gamedragonx> ah ok
[21:41] <inah8bit> which is where uh the "above average" players go to die
[21:41] <@gamedragonx> I'm excited to expire in the dead zone
[21:41] <inah8bit> been losing a lot. BibleThump
[21:41] <@gamedragonx> top 8 at CEO got me super amped
[21:42] <@gamedragonx> especially since there were no King players. I guess if I want a King there I have to do it myself

[19:51] <handlebar_orionx> I remember San Andreas had a strong soundtrack if you like early-mid 90's G funk and gangsta rap and R&B
[19:51] <buttspirate69> dude I love the characters and actors who played them
[19:52] <handlebar_orionx> The body acting is not as good as the vocal acting
[19:52] <handlebar_orionx> It's like if you told the mo-cap actors to move along with the lines but they never heard it before they started recording their movements
[19:53] <buttspirate69> it is really crazy but this made gta what it is
[19:53] <handlebar_orionx> It's hilariously bad body language
[19:53] <handlebar_orionx> I love this guy's run
[19:53] <buttspirate69> God best gta music ever I love 80s music
[19:54] <handlebar_orionx> It's like they picked some of the best 80's music
[19:54] <buttspirate69> They did for sure I remember being little and jamming to this
[19:54] <j0nsnow> u will die by falling
[19:55] <handlebar_orionx> The 80's and 90's were some of the best decades for music
[19:55] <handlebar_orionx> Some of the best songs and artists of all time came from those decades. Except for some of the one hit wonders
[19:56] <buttspirate69> I've never seen this game beaten or really know the story I was too little to play and when I was old enough they had newer ones :D
[19:56] <handlebar_orionx> Even the stuff that was popular to hate is easy to jam to unironically or ironically
[19:57] <j0nsnow> u should not stick near him
[19:57] <buttspirate69> upside music
[19:57] <buttspirate69> PogChamp
[19:57] <j0nsnow> u just need to follow them lol
[19:58] <j0nsnow> were is the "self control" song?
[19:58] <j0nsnow> where**
[19:58] <buttspirate69> I love the dark radio adds too
[19:59] <handlebar_orionx> He should be severely injured.
[20:00] <buttspirate69> dude where is lance
[20:00] <buttspirate69> isn't there a cheat too switch characters
[20:01] <buttspirate69> and gta 4 I spent the most time and I loved the dark cloudy weather
[20:01] <j0nsnow> gta iv cause its so dark and got dark story
[20:01] <buttspirate69> it was never sunny and decent graphics

[20:04] <buttspirate69> I got 100% on tbogt and infinite ammo it took a while
[20:04] <buttspirate69> because if you 100% you unlock infinite ammo
[20:04] <j0nsnow> tbogt's last mission was beast
[20:05] <buttspirate69> tlad was decent but Tony brought cars guns it was incredible
[20:06] <j0nsnow> they will change the icelands on gta 6
[20:06] <@jaystank> in a world covered by endless water... Jebaited
[20:06] <@jaystank> oh no
[20:06] <j0nsnow> you can be in different cities in gta 6, thats what i heard from many
[20:06] <@jaystank> what has science done now
[20:07] <buttspirate69> They should spend 8 years on a gta and make it immense and incredible id wait for that idk
[20:07] <buttspirate69> gta usually every 4 years
[20:08] <j0nsnow> you gotta admit that gta 5's story was not like other gta stories
[20:08] <@jaystank> i... i'm not sure 4Head
[20:08] <j0nsnow> it was more like family drama
[20:09] <buttspirate69> gta 5 felt good at first but didn't feel like a gta in a way I think too big of a step on new mechanics between character switching but good idea
[20:10] <buttspirate69> just felt different
[20:10] <j0nsnow> yes
[20:11] <@jaystank> now i'm definitely not sure
[20:11] <buttspirate69> They could o f added more to campaign too like activities but I think gta 4 had more than 5 :D
[20:11] <@jaystank> oh... oh no
[20:11] <buttspirate69> like comedy clubs irl stuff but didn't
[20:12] <j0nsnow> the difference between gta 4 story and gta 5 was that gta 4 was like real gta and gta 5 was just shit imo
[20:12] <j0nsnow> it felt like family drama story tbh
[20:13] <buttspirate69> yea 5 was like to all around 4 was awesome it was niko going to find a new life with his cousin who spoke so good about the American dream then niko seen how dark it was befriended people and made his way too the top like a movie
[20:14] <j0nsnow> yes exactly
[20:14] <buttspirate69> he did missions for people could eventually have a chance to kill them they had special pistol executions to
[20:14] <buttspirate69> it was cool
[20:16] <buttspirate69> number 4 just took everything to a level like actually being able to swim buy guns it was different and that's what made 4 so big for most people
[20:17] <j0nsnow> exactly

[20:18] <j0nsnow> even if they put it on miami it will not look like vice city game, the map will be really big and it will probably have mountains or bigass cities
[20:19] <buttspirate69> they should just let you fly to different places remaster all the old maps and make them travel to them
[20:19] <j0nsnow> eyyy thats not a bad idea tbh
[20:20] <buttspirate69> like how 5 you can fly and they had a North yankton glitch so why didn't they just let you fly to Yankton
[20:20] <buttspirate69> They had it built in as a glitch
[20:22] <j0nsnow> the game will probably be like 150gb to download if u can travel to all maps

[20:23] <buttspirate69> you added a dns thing I think if you look it up it was a modded thing I think I was on 360 back then and North yankton was in the sky and you could fly to it and there were no people but you could fight cops and hide in the bank
[20:24] <buttspirate69> Yeah it was cool

When some wild-eyed, eight-foot-tall maniac grabs your neck, taps the back of your favorite head up against the barroom wall, and he looks you crooked in the eye and he asks you if ya paid your dues, you just stare that big sucker right back in the eye, and you remember what ol' Jack Burton always says at a time like that: "Have ya paid your dues, Jack?"

[17:32] <handlebar_orionx> I wear my suuunglasses at night and I can't see a thing
[17:33] <venomoustoast> Its because they are not focusing on the dicks
[17:33] <handlebar_orionx> I think it's certain contexts
[17:33] <handlebar_orionx> Like, if it's a dildo, it's okay. And if it's non-sexualized nudity, it's okay
[17:33] <handlebar_orionx> But a troll game about genitalia is taboo. And gratuitous sexual acts are taboo
[17:34] <handlebar_orionx> Perhaps because Outlast is supposed to scare you, an not get you off? Unless that's your thing
[17:35] <handlebar_orionx> Too gratuitous?
[17:36] <handlebar_orionx> I bet you can't play that game with the 12 year old girl mashing sex dolls togetehr and trying to figure out how sex works.
[17:36] <handlebar_orionx> It exists
[17:36] <handlebar_orionx> I bet Hunnie Pop is off limits too as it's sexy bejeweled
[17:38] <handlebar_orionx> Basically, if it gratuitously shows or makes fun of or sexualizes sex, sexual organs and sex acts, it's banned. Except for GTA as long as you don't Hot Coffee Mod it

[02:23] <xbrcat> friday the 13th is boring when you are a the people, but Jason its awesome. The only problem is youre never really Jason
[02:24] <buttspirate69> like dead by day light has separate killers and tons of characters I like the stealth factor like if the killer sees you your screwed and if you get seen your dead. and f13 Jason is just idk I feel like they should of waited another year and actually added more it feels like it's not completed
[02:24] <buttspirate69> on f13 Jason is more cartoony and you can't really kill him without extra steps so pointleaa

[01:17] <notbutterfree_bird> The unified jumping physics in all 3 Crash games make some levels in Crash 1 and 2 harder than they should be. Giving you a warning should you play them.
[01:18] <notbutterfree_bird> The jumping is kinda like Mario's run in SMB1 where you need some momentum to make longer jumps or face death. Now the bridge is the level that makes people ragequit.

[01:24] <@actfast231> And I'm back from playing Monopoly with some friends
[01:24] <notbutterfree_bird> Most of the head pieces in the X games tend to be useless. X4 had arguably the best one with infinite ammo for basic special weapons.

[20:08] <juicyjuush> I'm ok with sales tax
[20:08] <juicyjuush> I hate income tax
[20:09] <stopperjj> @JuicyJuush you still pay federal income tax but no state income tax
[20:09] <juicyjuush> yea
[20:09] <juicyjuush> income tax is a sham
[20:09] <juicyjuush> luxury taxes should be a thing
[20:09] <juicyjuush> but there's too much to talk about there :P
[20:09] <justdaid> we have no state income tax in South Dakota either
[20:09] <juicyjuush> how is everyone :D
[20:10] <stopperjj> @JuicyJuush wait till you try to buy property. Property tax on a home is enough to make you faint. 1% can mean 3500 more in taxes a year.
[20:10] <juicyjuush> eliminating income tax benefits low income and allows you to choose where you put your money

[20:11] <juicyjuush> iof you want to buy a house and pay property taxes then that's your choice
[20:11] <@actfast231> Washington State also seems to lack state tax, so that coupled with $11/h minimum wage is pretty lit
[20:11] <juicyjuush> you can also choose to rent an apt :P

[20:12] <juicyjuush> well with most rentals you get benefits you don't get from buying
[20:12] <stopperjj> It's bc interest rates have fallen dramatically.
[20:12] <juicyjuush> something breaks you don't have to pay for it
[20:12] <juicyjuush> it's a trade off imo
[20:12] <stopperjj> If you have good credit it lowers your monthly rate significantly
[20:13] <juicyjuush> oh I get it
[20:13] <juicyjuush> I was just pointing it out :P
[20:14] <stopperjj> My last monthly rental amount was 1250 a month.
[20:14] <stopperjj> Thats for a 1bed 1 bath apartment
[20:14] <juicyjuush> this game reminds me a bit of hollow knight
[20:14] <juicyjuush> minnesota
[20:15] <stopperjj> I pay less for a 4bed 2.5 house on my mortgage now. LOL
[20:15] <stopperjj> Agreed. Fuck renting
[20:15] <juicyjuush> D:
[20:15] <juicyjuush> I loved hollow knight
[20:16] <justdaid> bless you
[20:16] <juicyjuush> ah, the art style was what made me want to play
[20:16] <juicyjuush> oh nice
[20:16] <stopperjj> I build apartments for a living too. They are not worth what most management companies charge in rent. It's insane.
[20:17] <juicyjuush> idk
[20:17] <juicyjuush> you gotta think about if they have a sauna, pool, library, gym, etc
[20:17] <juicyjuush> idk
[20:17] <justdaid> are you close enough to a real city you can get ubereats?
[20:17] <stopperjj> The average apartment costs about 110 to 120 per SF to build. They make that back in 10 years or less at full capacity.
[20:18] <juicyjuush> amazon is better than ubereats :X
[20:18] <juicyjuush> uber only delivers from like 3 places for me xD
[20:18] <juicyjuush> amazon like 70

[21:07] <justdaid> fiber is a joke btw... unless you have fiber in your house... you aint getting fiber
[21:07] <justdaid> and nobody has fiber
[21:08] <justdaid> in their house
[21:09] <@omegazeron> I mean to be fair I was talking more about before the move, which was in Indianapolis and I only got like 10mb down 1 up
[21:09] <@omegazeron> Here I get like 25 down 5 up
[21:11] <justdaid> the transition from fiber to coax is where the bottle neck is, so unless you have fiber running directly into your modem then you are not really benefiting from fiber
[21:11] <@omegazeron> Isn't this the game you managed to get out of bounds at the start of the game and when you reloaded you were still out of bounds?
[21:11] <justdaid> and since glass fiber does not make 90 degree angles very well I have yet to run into a house that is under a million that has actual fiber running through the walls
[21:13] <@actfast231> ngl I fell asleep paying down and you shouting dang it woke me/ scared the fuck outta me
[21:13] <justdaid> they run up to the building... but then transition to the coax at house level... and you lose the speed

[21:57] <justdaid> sorry, try this one
[21:57] <justdaid> https://pcpartpicker.com/list/KwYkBP
[21:58] <ryushura> wow wha a pc but why a Cooler Master - Hyper 212X thats a locked cpu right?
[22:00] <justdaid> I thought locked cpu had to do with the chip
[22:00] <justdaid> the coolermaster is the air cooler?
[22:01] <ryushura> ok
[22:01] <justdaid> its been almost 3 years since I built mine so if something has changed please let me know
[22:02] <justdaid> but usually the locked cpu had to do with how easy they are to over clock and the i5 is not locked on this one, you know if they are locked because they end with a k... or they used to

[22:04] <justdaid> for another $100 you can get an i7 but I know that is out of budget
[22:04] <ryushura> i was thiking the k was the unlocked ones
[22:06] <ryushura> i can save up a other 100 if need be
[22:07] <justdaid> its not really NEEDED... but an i7 is going to handle more processes on the back end of things, like your bot, OBS and the like

[22:05] <@actfast231> Crash 1's level design isn't structured to go fast and rush, so time relics are a fucker
[22:05] <@actfast231> Which is why I didn't bother and just went down the path of gems only bbgtvA
[22:05] <@actfast231> Sadly you NEED all the relics to get all the gems in Crash 3
[22:06] <@actfast231> No
[22:06] <notbutterfree_bird> But only gold is necessary. Platinum is optional in crash 3.
[22:06] <@actfast231> YES
[22:06] <notbutterfree_bird> Yes they did. You can save in the map.
[22:07] <notbutterfree_bird> And gem requirements are more lenient except for the colored gems which still require no deaths after you break the first checkpoint.
[22:07] <@actfast231> Stormy Ascent is not needed for 100% so don't stress it if it's god awful

[22:20] <justdaid> welcome... just sent me into a rant on twitter... no big
[22:20] <@actfast231> You want me to retweet you, AJ? Kappa
[22:21] <justdaid> people are now streaming vods of their old content and its landing in the live section on twitch
[22:21] <justdaid> so people are watching not live things on a live platform
[22:22] <@actfast231> Oh yeah, people aren't happy about VODcasts being bunged into live. Though apparently there's not a lot of them present atm
[22:22] <@actfast231> Like, out of top 50 LoL streams, only one is a VODcast
[22:22] <justdaid> and the big creators who are benefiting from it are saying that smaller creators are just whining because their recorded stuff is is more popular than a smaller streamer live
[22:23] <justdaid> its been something you could do for a while, but its recently picking up steam
[22:23] <justdaid> and no, they are in live... they are flagged, but still in live
[22:24] <@jaystank> is the tv trying to switch to something else automatically and then just... "oh, nothing there, back to the other one"?

[22:39] <captn_titan> they say you fall way faster in these games than the originals
[22:40] <notbutterfree_bird> The jumps are more weighty for sure.

[22:49] <quiverlip> didn't seem very tight y'know
[22:49] <notbutterfree_bird> Crash 1 definitely feels better with the d pad.
[22:49] <puffmax> to keep you on your toes
[22:50] <quiverlip> yeah it really does just shit enemies all over you
[22:50] <quiverlip> nothing really looked satisfying
[22:50] <quiverlip> and sam agreed with me on that
[22:50] <quiverlip> I don't /really/ know tho since I didn't play it
[22:50] <quiverlip> its also hard to find a game sam likes that isn't monster hunter so

[22:52] <@actfast231> Probably not, but it's your call. It might be nice to have it done so you don't have to replay the whole game again bbgtvA
[22:52] <puffmax> I'm level 200 on chapter 4
[22:52] <quiverlip> rip
[22:52] <quiverlip> you gonna pick up splatoon 2 ever?

[22:54] <quiverlip> it got really great tho
[22:54] <@actfast231> I played that game for a full year gibeGlee
[22:54] <quiverlip> and spla2n feels complete already
[22:54] <quiverlip> but is still getting shit tons of dlc
[22:54] <puffmax> They did great on keeping events and free content comin in with splatoon 1
[22:55] <notbutterfree_bird> You certainly will not like some levels further along because of the hitboxes.

[22:59] <quiverlip> you can turn off the damage numbers

[23:00] <quiverlip> Oh really?
[23:01] <puffmax> I'd like to drive across US, for the food mostly

[23:02] <@actfast231> Your reaction to Utah was incredible

[23:32] <notbutterfree_bird> As a tradeoff for dying and still getting the gem, you have to get all the bonus stage boxes too.
[23:33] <@hotsammysliz> yep it's a roguelike
[23:33] <quiverlip> shovel knight is absolutely an indie game lmao
[23:33] <@actfast231> I'd call it indie. At least it was initially
[23:33] <quiverlip> only got physicals because it was so popular
[23:34] <puffmax> I think the rogue lite metroidvania genre is oversaturated
[23:34] <@hotsammysliz> shovel knight is def an indie game
[23:34] <quiverlip> indie means independent dev
[23:34] <@hotsammysliz> publisher
[23:34] <puffmax> funding? publisher?
[23:34] <quiverlip> yacht club was independent soo
[23:34] <notbutterfree_bird> I guess it could be considered a AA game.
[23:34] <@actfast231> Undetale is indie, even if it got a lot of exposure. Some might argue OVERexposure but that's neither here nor there

[23:35] <@actfast231> Getting that funding from a publisher after the release doesn't make it less indie
[23:36] <notbutterfree_bird> It's like Yooka Laylee. It's developers from a past well known companie, but had crowdfunding as its main source of advertisement with maybe some private funding.
[23:36] <@hotsammysliz> Yeah like the devs (Kickstarter lol)are paying for it. it's indie
[23:37] <puffmax> I would say team size and development cost is my contributing factor for an "indie" dev
[23:37] <quiverlip> indie also means they aren't part of any big corporation or anything
[23:37] <quiverlip> just people wanting to make a cool game
[23:37] <quiverlip> well that was the start of the industry right
[23:37] <@hotsammysliz> like yeah old school games WERE indie
[23:37] <quiverlip> before there were AAA devs
[23:37] <quiverlip> there didn't need to be a distinction

[23:39] <@hotsammysliz> like that stuff wasn't being done before. nobody knew if it was gonna work
[23:39] <@actfast231> It's a way to separate a game made by EA with a giant dev team from someone's college project that they bunged on Steam
[23:39] <@hotsammysliz> they were Essentially amateurs in the gaming industry

[23:41] <quiverlip> indies also have a lot less money to throw around for marketing and shit like that
[23:41] <@hotsammysliz> ^

[23:41] <quiverlip> rather than throwing everything into the same pile

[23:42] <@hotsammysliz> shovel knights an indie game lol
[23:42] <quiverlip> shovel knight wasn't really advertised in the same sense as AAA shit

[23:43] <quiverlip> yeah I guess thats true
[23:43] <quiverlip> doesn't matter much
[23:43] <puffmax> Look, humanity has a need to classify things. Biology alone has species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain classifications for just one animal.

[23:46] <@hotsammysliz> well the reason indie games are thing is because before that you couldn't just make a game without working at one of these big companies using their proprietary hardware and software. so people began doing stuff on thier own not having to take orders from a publisher in order to get paid to continue making thier game. as a result of that that made games and teams indie

[23:51] <@actfast231> Also as a side note, I finally got a Plat relic in Crash 1... in Boulders. brownMAN
[23:51] <@hotsammysliz> Idk just feel like nothings new anymore lol. which is a reallllly dumb way to think but idk. shit just bores me so fast
[23:51] <killer749012> last game I bought was bloodborne
[23:52] <quiverlip> honestly I still think games are pretty great
[23:52] <quiverlip> 2017 has been damn amazing so far
[23:52] <killer749012> dark souls never got my attention
[23:52] <puffmax> I still buy games even if i don't play it, simply to support the game and/or it's direction

[23:53] <killer749012> bloodborne only got it because how good it look and how more challenging it was
[23:53] <@hotsammysliz> what came out this year? botw, hollow knight?
[23:53] <puffmax> I bought RE7, haven't opened it yet
[23:53] <@actfast231> Speaking of indie games, a game I didn't expect to be good but is actually kinda clean: The Unfinished Swan
[23:53] <quiverlip> persona 5
[23:53] <quiverlip> nier automata
[23:53] <@hotsammysliz> Oh persona. splat2
[23:53] <notbutterfree_bird> Still no final date, but DQ11 will be out next year.

[23:54] <quiverlip> but like big open worlds are not usually my deal
[23:54] <puffmax> I enjoyed Horizon this year
[23:54] <@hotsammysliz> Yeah I think I'm just too much of an adult lol.
[23:54] <@hotsammysliz> also addicted to mh
[23:54] <quiverlip> sonic mania coming soon
[23:54] <quiverlip> yeah
[23:54] <puffmax> Horizon is the only game I have ever bothered to Platinum
[23:55] <quiverlip> you've got a lot going on
[23:55] <@actfast231> Is Sonic Forces 2017 or 2018?
[23:55] <puffmax> supposedly it's 2017
[23:55] <@hotsammysliz> it hurts
[23:55] <puffmax> but no confirm date I think
[23:55] <@hotsammysliz> it hurts so bad

[23:56] <quiverlip> I'm sorry act
[23:56] <@actfast231> You gotta understand, I loved Unleashed and Generations, I need this

[23:57] <@actfast231> Lost World, and BOOM, I nEeD a good 3D Sonic game
[23:57] <quiverlip> but forces
[23:57] <quiverlip> not looking so amazing
[23:57] <@hotsammysliz> lost world. also good
[23:57] <quiverlip> lost world kinda bad ngl
[23:57] <puffmax> on a related note I played Switch while sitting on a mountain top, does that count
[23:57] <puffmax> really more of a 20 year old idiot
[23:58] <@actfast231> I mean... I can't help that I genuinely love 3D Sonic and am bored by 2D Sonic.
[23:58] <quiverlip> oh yeah I forgot

[00:27] <notbutterfree_bird> I don't think it was intentional. It just so happened that muscle memory in the old days will fail us here so it's all about unlearning that to get used to the controls here.
[00:27] <puffmax> tricky, dicky, monkeys

[00:31] <notbutterfree_bird> Well I was able to get 99 lives thanks to playing this game just like the original. No deaths when getting gems.
[00:32] <notbutterfree_bird> There's a little opening in the second torch that's not spiked.
[00:32] <@actfast231> Use the missing spike pillar to wait out for a better time
[00:33] <@hotsammysliz> lmao fuck. that fall lol
[00:33] <quiverlip> I've fallen down this entire thing
[00:33] <notbutterfree_bird> Basically the way it was developed since it was built from the ground up. And also they wanted to unify all 3 crash games' jumping physics.
[00:34] <@actfast231> I promise the level design gets nicer in Crash 2 and 3
[00:35] <notbutterfree_bird> Plus sometimes when you jump forward, the momentum carries with you like how super mario bros jump needed a full run.

[00:37] <quiverlip> water is important
[00:37] <@actfast231> I think this is one of 5 levels I relic'd. Because fuck it's just so fun
[00:38] <@actfast231> Crash 3 really opens up the levels
[00:39] <notbutterfree_bird> It does, but I feel like most of the vehicle levels did not age well. The motorcycle is so stiff when you try to turn.
[00:39] <@actfast231> The plane stuff is nice

[01:28] <@actfast231> They're marathoning anime right now
[01:29] <dadsprivatetime> If Im not mistaken, isnt the timing for some obstacles in this remake messed up?

[04:59] <@hotsammysliz> and yesss well... hmm probably swap legend of Mana w mml since mml was actually a 3ds game

[22:29] <mirby_studios> AJ are you planning on platinuming these games?
[22:30] <mirby_studios> i don't usually platinum games and i platinumed these three lol, it's not AS bad... except the gold relic on this fucking stage
[22:31] <quiverlip> This stage is hell
[22:31] <@omegazeron> And my internet is in the trashcan ResidentSleeper
[22:31] <notbutterfree_bird> Indeed. Lost at least 20 lives to this.

[22:31] <mirby_studios> well you WOULD be able to but the hitboxes make that hard
[22:31] <notbutterfree_bird> Those hitboxes are why this level is hell.
[22:31] <mirby_studios> how did you lose lives on a relic run
[22:31] <leon_maxwell431> @SimplyAJ your still in chill mode
01[22:31] <@asimplebot> /me
[22:32] <mirby_studios> oh it wasn't on purpose
[22:32] <mirby_studios> they did the best they could and for what they did it's quite awesome since they didn't have the source codes for the originals AT ALL iirc
03[22:32] * rlfunky (rlfunky@rlfunky.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[22:32] <mirby_studios> but yeah
[22:32] <mirby_studios> also everyone agrees: not even stormy ascent is as bad as this goddamn stage
[22:32] <@omegazeron> My upload, at 5mb, is faster than my download ResidentSleeper
[22:32] <killer749012> o the turtle lvl
01[22:32] <@asimplebot> /me
[22:33] <quiverlip> Stormy ascent is crazy easy compared to this
03[22:33] * killer749012 (killer749012@killer749012.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[22:34] <quiverlip> Stormy ascent in general wasn't even bad imo tho
[22:34] <mirby_studios> one thing i've noticed is the game remembers when you got pity masks and how many you had so in future visits to stages you got pity masks in if you die you'll get them right away

[22:35] <@omegazeron> LOL
[22:35] <mirby_studios> that stutter step was integral to me getting the gold in this stage
[22:35] <@omegazeron> That was
[22:35] <@omegazeron> A death animation
[22:35] <@omegazeron> I guess
[22:35] <handlebar_orionx> Watup AJ
01[22:35] <@asimplebot> /me
[22:36] <mirby_studios> yeah it lets you clear longer jumps than you'd think possible
[22:36] <mirby_studios> like this turtle segment with perfectly timed stutter jumps you only need like two turtles lol
[22:36] <notbutterfree_bird> You don't need that second turle for the jump.
[22:37] <notbutterfree_bird> Or damage boost.
[22:37] <mirby_studios> damage boost ftw

[22:38] <@omegazeron> LOL
[22:38] <killer749012> o0o he taking the easy way out
[22:38] <mirby_studios> like that
[22:39] <mirby_studios> it's the hitboxes
[22:39] <@omegazeron> LUL
[22:39] <mirby_studios> this game is all about the H I T B O X B O Y Z
[22:39] <mirby_studios> and how they fucking hate your guys
[22:39] <mirby_studios> *guts too
[22:40] <handlebar_orionx> Are you pushing up on the d pad rather than the left stick?
[22:40] <quiverlip> I thought stormy ascent wasn't bad at all
[22:40] <mirby_studios> it really wasn't
[22:40] <quiverlip> And this was hard for me
[22:41] <mirby_studios> technically this morning
[22:42] <mirby_studios> lol
[22:43] <notbutterfree_bird> It's like Super Mario Bros 1.
[22:43] <handlebar_orionx> Try standing on the steel box when the TNT explodes
[22:44] <mirby_studios> well these were originally for saving the game so having them work as checkpoints makes sense lol
[22:44] <mirby_studios> even if they did that then
[22:44] <handlebar_orionx> Well so much for that
[22:44] <mirby_studios> see orion, you killed aj. way to go
[22:45] <mirby_studios> if you jump at the right moment off the steel crate you're safe
[22:45] <mirby_studios> this is obviously a dream world
[22:45] <notbutterfree_bird> Imagine doing this if the no death requirement was still a thing.

[22:48] <mirby_studios> you can die all you want before a checkpoint and still get the gem

[22:50] <mirby_studios> it's this one
[22:50] <notbutterfree_bird> Lights out and Fumbling in the Dark.
[22:50] <mirby_studios> the stage after this
[22:51] <mirby_studios> you can't get the color gem in lights out until you get the yellow gem in one of the last stages

[23:37] <glackum> @Mirby_Studios i honestly think they didnt playtest it
[23:37] <handlebar_orionx> *Snow
[23:38] <mirby_studios> they had to have to set the times for time trials though
[23:38] <glackum> playtesting implies they played it to test
[23:38] <handlebar_orionx> "Would they see a po boy? No siree. They're see a $5 footlong only at Subway"
[23:38] <glackum> not to set some rekkies 🤔
[23:39] <mirby_studios> going through each stage to get times for it would require testing the game though lol
[23:39] <mirby_studios> more playtesting could have been done though
[23:39] <mirby_studios> especially if they'd done it side-by-side with the original
[23:39] <handlebar_orionx> "issinuhh. T'make kiiings aaand a bag of bonds. Buhleeeead thuuuh beeenuheeeeeh..."
[23:39] <glackum> theres a lot of time trials that have desynced cycles

[00:04] <handlebar_orionx> Funny story involving Lion King. So, when i was 5, I used to live on a golf course town home. And there were asshole golfers pissing in my back yard exposing themselves to my sister and I. So to prank them one day, my mom puts in the Lion King on the VCR, pauses it right before the sunset, and cranks up the surround sound. We wait for one of the old guy golfers to get ready for a swing. We crack open the patio door... He goes for the swing... "NAAAAAAANTS INGONYAAAAAMA" the guyfreaks out
[00:04] <@andrewarcade> can't wait to get home and crack some nut juice
[00:04] <mirby_studios> splitting the cost for a mutual birthday present
[00:04] <mirby_studios> so you're saying rafiki was so excited that simba was alive that he nutted
[00:05] <mirby_studios> seems legit

[00:08] <handlebar_orionx> A fun fact about Lion King. The intro is screaming "nants ingonyama bagithi baba" which is Zulu for "look father, there is a lion." Then the choir says "sithi hu ingonyama" which means "yes son, I see the lion" So essentially the intro is "DAAAAAAAAAD Look over theeeere that's a lion!" "Yes sooooon I seee the lioooon..."

[02:15] <timdragonkid> just finished bloodborne
[02:15] <@actfast231> Another Wild Hog level and another dark corridor level

[02:18] <mirby_studios> yes you have all the color gems
[02:18] <mirby_studios> the rest of the gems in the game are clear, so no worries about deathless runs
[02:18] <mirby_studios> pause really quick and you can double check
[02:19] <mirby_studios> btw i love how they consolidated the progress screens
[02:19] <mirby_studios> "Fuuulawwwwck" -AJ 2017
[02:20] <mirby_studios> like in crash 2 and 3 it cycled through how many relics and gems and crystals you had but now it's just one view
[02:20] <mirby_studios> it's easier to criss-cross across
[02:20] <mirby_studios> not easy, just easier lol
[02:21] <mirby_studios> on the plus side you got the 99 lives trophy while in the lab so there's that
[02:21] <@actfast231> Bit of a random topic, but anyone notice something of a rise in Youtubers taking extended breaks or voicing intense stress?
[02:21] <@omegazeron> Apparently YouTube is being fucks and not actually paying properly for their videos
[02:21] <@omegazeron> Someone with 11 mil subs got $0 first week
[02:21] <mirby_studios> meanwhile i'm still waiting for the affiliate email ;_;
[02:21] <@actfast231> Par for the course. Sadly, Youtube is a pretty shit course
[02:22] <@actfast231> Youtube also doesn't talk to anyone ever
[02:22] <justdaid> the problem is that people are fickle fucks and the second somebody takes a break even for a week they lose subscribers like blood from a main artery
[02:23] <mirby_studios> that was such a lucky checkpoint hit
[02:23] <justdaid> oh yeah, Twitch isnt much better
[02:24] <@actfast231> Well that's due to algorithm on Youtube harshly punishing people who don't frequently upload

[19:42] <justdaid> also, Netflix is going to lose to Hulu and Amazon because they are losing all the good rerun binge shows.... its fine to have originals... but you need the things that keep people coming back
[19:43] <justdaid> HBO is loosing out because people sub for GoT and then leave when its over...
[19:44] <xbrcat> what about westworld? Don't people like that?
[19:44] <justdaid> some do yes
[19:44] <justdaid> but they have all of these high end shows that go away for 1+ years at a time

[19:51] <ryushura> so aj are u excited about mh worlds
[19:51] <@hotsammysliz> i didnt know

[19:51] <xbrcat> well im sorrry for asking a question. Gosh jk

[19:53] <@omegazeron> But if you get it on PS4 then I won't be able to play with you 4Head
[19:53] <@omegazeron> I don't have a PS4
[19:53] <justdaid> "PC's are not made for gaming" ~AJ 2017
[19:53] <justdaid> I will be getting it on both just so I can pretend to have friends too AJ
[19:53] <@omegazeron> I mean you are actually right about that
[19:53] <@omegazeron> PCs were not designed for gaming
[19:54] <@omegazeron> But people have made gaming PCs
[19:54] <@omegazeron> But they're not exclusive
[19:54] <@omegazeron> Like a console will play games
[19:54] <@omegazeron> And maybe do internet
[19:54] <@omegazeron> But they're for games
[19:55] <xbrcat> i wish monster hunter world was planned for switch. But at least switch is getting a mh game in Japan only
[19:55] <justdaid> its okay AJ... I am just going to keep quoting it... because
[19:56] <@omegazeron> I mean so far it's only in Japan
[19:56] <@omegazeron> We don't know if it's getting localized or not
[19:56] <@hotsammysliz> yeah
[19:56] <@hotsammysliz> mhworld aint coming to switch lmao
[19:56] <@hotsammysliz> sell it and get a ps4 bbgtvA
[19:56] <@omegazeron> Remember the guy who said MHW was Switch exclusive 4Head
[19:57] <ryushura> do anyone other then me even want to play MHS still
[19:57] <@hotsammysliz> LOL
[19:57] <@hotsammysliz> ye ima still get that day one ryu
[19:57] <xbrcat> i have ps4 but i want more switch games
[19:57] <justdaid> I will pick up MHS, it looks pretty fun
[19:57] <@omegazeron> Ye I'm definitely getting Stories
[19:57] <justdaid> what power does it need... put a graphics slider on it and call it good
[19:58] <justdaid> its not going to look like it does on PS4, but it would still be playable

[21:18] <stopperjj> Kid= plenty of time and energy but no money; adult= monye and energy, but not time; old age= money and time, but no energy

[23:01] <@ehlea> There's another crash I forgot
[23:01] <@ehlea> Why are we here
[23:02] <@actfast231> He is based off a Crash plush that was sold in Japan around the PS1 games that looked fucking freakish
[23:03] <@ehlea> wasn't there another legit crash
[23:03] <@ehlea> who was all messed up though
[23:03] <@actfast231> Crunch?
[23:03] <@actfast231> Or are you thinking of Fake Crash? Because he's in CTR?

[23:23] <justdaid> it will happen, in due time

[23:24] <@ehlea> we wanted a lot of things and we didnt get them though
[23:25] <@ehlea> so ill be bawkGrump about it
[23:26] <@actfast231> Hmm, random thought but I wonder how differently I'm gonna experience FF7 by waiting to play the remake gibeThink brownTHINK
[23:26] <@ehlea> ill be on that boat with ya act
[23:27] <@actfast231> Pro tip, don't get the checkpoint boxes save the one that triggers the countdown
[23:27] <@actfast231> Yeah, but it looks so... clunky OpieOP
[23:28] <@ehlea> ^
[23:28] <@ehlea> ive seen those hands and i cant stand it
[23:29] <@ehlea> were too spoiled act i guess OpieOP
[23:29] <@actfast231> I think the idea is that you gotta either run over and kill them on foot, or just blast through with Aku Aku
[23:30] <@ehlea> why is there a random bs 4 head on the screen

[23:34] <@actfast231> Pfft, don't worry Alisha. I almost never like old games bbgtvA
[23:34] <@ehlea> i look at those hands
[23:34] <@ehlea> and i wanna burn it
[23:34] <@ehlea> i have it though OpieOP
[23:34] <@actfast231> Those fucking piston lookin hands
[23:34] <cha0tiktvgaming> It wasn't just XSplit. My entire PC was acting up
[23:35] <cha0tiktvgaming> I updated the Motherboard CPU and Ram
[23:35] <cha0tiktvgaming> FF7 must be experienced as is before the remake
[23:35] <@actfast231> But did you see that KH combat? That shit's clean
[23:35] <@actfast231> Or rather, the KH styled combat that's not at all turn based
[23:35] <@simplyaj> That shit's not FF7 4Head 4Head 4Head
[23:35] <cha0tiktvgaming> You need to play it with all of the mistranslations and such before really appriciating the need for a FF7 Remake
[23:36] <@simplyaj> ^^^^^
[23:36] <cha0tiktvgaming> It's nothing like KH Combat

[23:36] <cha0tiktvgaming> My Reaction to updating my PC after fixing it @SimplyAJ: https://twitter.com/ts0cha0tik/status/892839947203489792
[23:37] <@actfast231> Oh yeah, apparently the remake is also episodic? But like, supposedly each episode will be a full game in terms of content and length.
[23:37] <@simplyaj> Yeah that's fucking terrible OneHand
[23:37] <cha0tiktvgaming> It's only because Twitter messed up the vid haha it's amazing that it's fixed
[23:37] <@actfast231> Because FF7 is apparently the Lord of the Rings of video games
[23:37] <cha0tiktvgaming> That's so wrong lol
[23:37] <cha0tiktvgaming> FF7 isn't the best FF
[23:38] <cha0tiktvgaming> just a standard
[23:38] <cha0tiktvgaming> Alright AJ

[00:25] <@gamedragonx> pretty much just how it sounds. they have a gaming division I guess. Set up booths at majors with stations for people to play, contests, sponsor some esports teams
[00:25] <@gamedragonx> the usual, really. Why? Who knows lol
[00:25] <ryushura> asking what geico has to do with gameing is like asking why do pornhub have a esports team do ask just run with it

[00:29] <xbrcat> wait a team called youporn is going in Disney
[00:29] <@gamedragonx> Kreygasm
[00:30] <@gamedragonx> YouPorn has a gaming team, thats only called Team YP

[00:47] <@actfast231> I have no idea where her house is. All these houses look the same brownCRY
[00:47] <@actfast231> Ooooh
[00:47] <@gamedragonx> I like Sonic Spinball. Still
[00:47] <@gamedragonx> yeah her house doesn't look slummy
[00:47] <@gamedragonx> you'll see it after a screen change
[00:48] <@actfast231> Of course StabWound would have the nicest house. Goddamn anime protags... gibeY
[00:48] <xbrcat> i been playing MGS5 Ground Zeroes it came with Phantom Pain. im liking it. this sis my first mgs game. Also i know what happens at the end of mgs5 tpp. So I spoiled the ending fir me. i was confused when iseen it
[00:48] <@gamedragonx> yeah after the house scene it should be pretty straight-forward with what you have to do next
[00:49] <@gamedragonx> FF7 was a fun playthrough, I do have to admit. Didn't end up being my favorite FF but still worth it
[00:49] <@gamedragonx> minus that shitty RTS game

[00:51] <@gamedragonx> S2 is still going. Its probably over soon though
[00:52] <@gamedragonx> they talked about it briefly in past eps, but he has insane reaction time and even though he's outwardly salty he's actually really smart
[00:52] <@gamedragonx> I think he's like top 5 grades in the class

[02:14] <@jaystank> an inanimate object dp'd you
[02:14] <@jaystank> science has gone too far
[02:14] <@actfast231> It sure did gibeGlee
[02:14] <@gamedragonx> this was the Turks theme right?
[02:15] <@gamedragonx> you know, I didn't really care for that band of comedians
[02:15] <@gamedragonx> but they helped me get white Mr. T, and for that I'll be forever grateful
[02:15] <@actfast231> Oh, that dickhead who tried running up on StabWound?
[02:18] <@actfast231> I named Cloud after myself at least
[02:18] <@actfast231> AKA Act
[02:18] <@gamedragonx> did I change any names? I don't think I did honestly. I just verbally called them different things
[02:18] <inah8bit> I reallyu like how
[02:18] <inah8bit> people asked for
[02:19] <inah8bit> an HD remake of this
[02:19] <inah8bit> and there's SOOO much salt.
[02:19] <@gamedragonx> people forgot this game aged worse than MM Legends
[02:19] <inah8bit> as a kid,
[02:19] <inah8bit> I remember this game
[02:19] <inah8bit> being salt inducing
[02:19] <inah8bit> This shit was hard as a kid and I had the patience of a shaolin monk
[02:19] <notbutterfree_bird> Well this game causes people to have to unlearn their muscle memory for this, at least for crash.
[02:19] <inah8bit> and as a grown adult with a lot of feelings I can't play Crash ever again.
[02:20] <inah8bit> I guess patience is not the word
[02:20] <@actfast231> Also AJ, you can't give me the option to name NPCs and expect me not to name at least SOME of them mems
[02:20] <inah8bit> I just had so much time as a child
[02:20] <notbutterfree_bird> I know I must have my revenge on Crash 2 for denying me 100% back in the day.
[02:20] <@gamedragonx> but yeah, I rarely ever change names in RPGs. Except Persona 5 because they erased his name and wouldn't let me enter it as default
[02:21] <inah8bit> I used to change main character's names to the name of my crush back then
[02:21] <inah8bit> Tales of games.
[02:21] <@gamedragonx> ...wow
[02:21] <inah8bit> and.. Xenosaga
[02:21] <notbutterfree_bird> Back then I was a sucky gamer so I relied on a lot of cheat codes until Puzzle Fighter caused me to git gud.
[02:22] <@gamedragonx> shoutouts to Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo
[02:22] <inah8bit> only main character ofcourse.
[02:22] <@gamedragonx> Crush-Senpai
[02:22] <notbutterfree_bird> It was probably the first game that I finally beat my older brother in something.
[02:22] <inah8bit> I did it for uhh
[02:22] <inah8bit> Tales of Destiny 2(Eternia)
[02:23] <inah8bit> where Reid's name was my crush's and Farah's name was Inah.
[02:23] <inah8bit> Tales of Eternia is a lovely game.
[02:23] <@gamedragonx> that's so sweet. I feel like I just ate a handful of sugar
[02:23] <@actfast231> Does this wrap area we're in rn have Bee-Having?
[02:24] <@actfast231> Cause JUST after the first checkpoint there's a bee hive, and killing all the bees that pop out in a wave gives a life. So you can sit in front of the hive and kill bees and farm lives

[02:33] <notbutterfree_bird> You can't go back once you fall.

[02:35] <notbutterfree_bird> I got distracted by other things.
[02:35] <@gamedragonx> I've never played this mess. I just listed like 20 reasons why lol
[02:36] <notbutterfree_bird> This stage is the main culprit for denied 100% completion.
[02:37] <@jaystank> aren't you glad people voted for crash instead of... anything else. OneHand
[02:37] <@gamedragonx> oh look, Fighting Force also came out in 97
[02:37] <inah8bit> LUL
[02:37] <inah8bit> I never knew
[02:37] <notbutterfree_bird> I remember fighting force. I love that beat em up even though I'm sure it hasn't aged well.
[02:37] <inah8bit> I never 100%'d
[02:37] <inah8bit> crash
[02:38] <inah8bit> i've never 100%d any game when I was young
[02:38] <inah8bit> other than JRPGs
[02:38] <@gamedragonx> there's no way this game was designed with 100% in mind
[02:38] <@gamedragonx> otherwise these design choices make no sense
[02:38] <notbutterfree_bird> Yep. This level trolls hard.
[02:39] <@gamedragonx> a person back then bought this over literally 20 AA titles. Weren't they trolled hard enough already
[02:39] <inah8bit> gurl you know its intended
[02:39] <inah8bit> Crash is a giant troll
[02:39] <@gamedragonx> imagine someone who only bought this in 1997
[02:39] <@gamedragonx> S H A M B L E S
[02:39] <@jaystank> that poor man
[02:40] <notbutterfree_bird> It was impressive that Crash 2 was a huge improvement over Crash 1 with just one year of development. You'll never see this much effort nowadays.

[01:56] <@actfast231> I think the colored gem is accessed via a secret entrance to the level that you get by acquiring a certain amount of relics
[01:56] <dj_crazicee2015> it's all good man that's a Sunday
[01:56] <@actfast231> I think like... 10?
[01:57] <@actfast231> You could do that. It's probably smarter than what my dumbass is doing, which is grabbing them as I go
[01:58] <@actfast231> Ah yes, the motorbike stages. The gross precursor to the magic of CTR
[01:58] <@actfast231> You got the box gem, no worries
[01:59] <@actfast231> I think in the bike stages you just gotta get the boxes, it'll give it to you by default then

[02:37] <vulturusmidnite> fair enough, i'm doing alright, just finished getting those platinum relics for crash 3.
[02:37] <vulturusmidnite> you can shorten vulturus to vulture if thats easier
[02:37] <@actfast231> They don't wanna pay for it
[02:37] <@actfast231> It's absolutely a money thing
[02:38] <vulturusmidnite> thats what im doing, relics last, started with crash 3 plat relics though
[02:38] <@actfast231> My plan for when I move is to take my electronics, electronics, and any furniture that can't get infected, and leave literally everything else, clothing included

[02:39] <@actfast231> $170-$300, I think? But even when I offered to pay they told me no. I guess they don't wanna take the family and pets out for the day?? So even if I had the money it'd be a tough sell
[02:40] <vulturusmidnite> Crash 2 is my favorite. i loved the secret warp zone requiring secrets, not time relics. and then color gems are all unique methods
[02:40] <vulturusmidnite> and the less alt gameplay

[02:43] <vulturusmidnite> SOME, are okay. but crash 3 puts them all infront of your face. for example, EVERY bonus level is alt gameplay
[02:44] <@actfast231> I guess nobody cares? At least, not enough to take real action. Just the occasional carpet shampoo and wash of clothes and sheets.
[02:44] <vulturusmidnite> 14/30 levels are actual platforming
[02:45] <vulturusmidnite> AND thats including eggipus rex as platforming

[02:47] <vulturusmidnite> 13/28 platforming levels where you can enter from the main hub directly
[02:48] <vulturusmidnite> crash 3 is mostly forward, backwards or alt gameplay.
03[02:48] * midknightcherry (midknightcherry@midknightcherry.tmi.twitch.tv) has joined #simplyaj
[02:49] <vulturusmidnite> crash 2 has forward, backwards, some sidewars and then alt gameplay but not as much, animal riding levels, that water jet-levels which incorperates some platforming aswell, then the jet-pack
03[02:49] * peckapon (peckapon@peckapon.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[02:50] <vulturusmidnite> Crash 3 would be better keeping those alt gameplay to 2 levels each max. no 4 bike levels, no 4 jet ski levels, no 3 flying levels
[02:51] <@actfast231> Oh yeah, I been meaning to mention that, if I were to solve the bedbug issue to visit, it wouldn't be August actually. Couldn't get dat paper
[02:51] <vulturusmidnite> Crash 3 has the best first hub in my opinion, every level is unique. after that the game falls apart
[02:53] <vulturusmidnite> Platforming forward, underwater, animal riding, platforming backwards, jet ski. teaches you the main things.
[02:54] <vulturusmidnite> i find it easy, spin the same time you jump. slight tap it
[02:55] <vulturusmidnite> the super spin you gotta keep tapping anyways to use it, so you can avoid using it

[03:25] <vulturusmidnite> you cant make a pre-made lobby in splatoon until splatfest. splatfests is once per month, but splatfests become region locked so if your friends with others elsewhere you cant play with them for 24-36 hours. if your their 4th in a group, they can't even group up with each other as you cant join them
[03:25] <@andrewarcade> My biggest gripe is that Salmon Run is only on certain days
[03:25] <@andrewarcade> and Salmon Run is my favorite part of Splatoon 2
[03:26] <@actfast231> Snake fucked my shit up, my dude

[03:26] <vulturusmidnite> then using statistics as part of their mobile app DansGame

[03:37] <vulturusmidnite> its a tricky one to perform, harder to do it multiple times consistantly within the level. but you slide, spin, then jump onto something higher and continue a tornado spin. it'll make your spin at an angle and move alot faster. easiest to do uphill

[02:21] <wolfhandle> lol something like that
[02:22] <wolfhandle> i was making gay jokes nonstop at work
[02:23] <wolfhandle> just because my customers were taking advantage on me, especially when my shift was over.
[02:23] <@actfast231> Gay jokes in 2017 tho brownLUL
[02:24] <wolfhandle> omg hang on i need to remember now
[02:25] <@actfast231> I mean, gay jokes are usually made with implication that there's something wrong with the premise.
[02:25] <@actfast231> Like... "Going off to blow a guy, ey?" or something. Like, "Sure am, what's the problem?"

[02:27] <@actfast231> It's just silly
[02:28] <wolfhandle> okay i remember that most of my customers wants to taste some of my ice cream samples and walk away without buying them, so i got a little mad at them for not buying anything. by the time when i was all by myself and then a married couple come in being all shy or debatable on what they want to order so i had to step in and asked them if they wanted to give a few taste of my ice cream samples and added with a comment saying that i don't bite...well except for guys wink wink nudge nudge.
[02:28] <wolfhandle> idk i can barely remember what i said next
[02:28] <elite_echo> Depends on the tone of the joke

[02:29] <elite_echo> Being funny or being hurtful
[02:29] <joshipgirl> There's plenty of jokes that are funny that don't involve a basis of "X is bad/wrong etc."
[02:29] <@actfast231> I mean, that's still straight gibeGlee
[02:30] <@actfast231> A girl making dick sucking jokes about other girls is still a straight thing.
[02:30] <elite_echo> Most jokes are situational anyways

[02:29] <g33koftrades> I understand. The beginning of my stream was RNG heavy and it took me over an hour and a half to get a run going.
[02:30] <g33koftrades> Harvest Moon (SNES) and I am working on optimizing the run because only three people run it
[02:31] <g33koftrades> I've been streaming since Thursday and I'm already second place on the speedrun dot com leaderboards

[02:41] <@actfast231> Just Sonic. None of this Tails bullshit itsajA
[02:41] <xbrcat> which game we talking about?
[02:42] <@actfast231> Mania. I'm playing along at home. Sorta. I'm not stressing Emeralds or medals
[02:42] <@actfast231> Oh. You know what, I'm mixing up acts and stages
[02:43] <xbrcat> ITS THE NIGHT ONE!!
[02:43] <xbrcat> i like this one
[02:43] <@actfast231> That's fair. I've never been huge on special stages myself. Though the 3D UFO chase this game rocks is easily the most enjoyable special stage I've played
[02:43] <@actfast231> Which is a low bar, granted
[02:45] <@actfast231> But to answer your question more plainly, I'm 12 levels in. I've seen 6 unique environments

[03:37] <@andrewarcade> Tetris effect is a phenomenon where people played so much tetris that they started to see it in their everyday life
[03:37] <@andrewarcade> As in they would close their eyes and could visualize tetris
[03:37] <xbrcat> level, boss what are these things?
[03:37] <@andrewarcade> Painters also get it, with the scenes of doing brush strokes non-stop
[03:37] <@andrewarcade> I also had it when I played Rock Band a lot and would see the tracks in my mind all the time
[03:37] <@actfast231> The bosses in this game are diabolical at times
[03:38] <@andrewarcade> 'The Tetris effect (also known as Tetris Syndrome) occurs when people devote so much time and attention to an activity that it begins to pattern their thoughts, mental images, and dreams.'

[07:52] <@hotsammysliz> oh so you hit the bumperball then quick turned around and jumped then hit the yellow bounce ball. so since you hit the bumper ball that makes you run backwards for like 4 squares then you start running forward. it just so happened that that backwards run count ran out mid yellow ball jump so you started going forward again mid jump lol
[07:52] <@hotsammysliz> tbh thats really nice mechanics lol
[07:52] <thedragonbingplaysxboxpc1> just a couple more minutes until the Xbox player play sonic mania!!
[07:53] <dadsprivatetime> Most of the CD levels are kind of forgettable.

[04:08] <darksydegeoff> like sonic 2
[04:08] <shinomei> Yeah there is
[04:08] <darksydegeoff> nice
[04:09] <shinomei> One of the reasons why I chose the Switch Version making it easier to play Co-op
[04:09] <darksydegeoff> yeah i can imagine switch is a lot better just because of portability
03[04:10] * deleef (deleef@deleef.tmi.twitch.tv) has left #simplyaj
[04:10] <shinomei> Being able to bring your switch everywhere and play co-op on a table outside or bring it to your friends house.
[04:10] <darksydegeoff> the switch has an OS memory leak
[04:11] <darksydegeoff> well, if i had to take a guess
[04:11] <shinomei> Especially for me being a University Student I like to bring it over to hang out with some friends and play some co-op .
[04:11] <darksydegeoff> getting stuff on PC is really easy because steam's verification process is almost jackshit lol
[04:11] <darksydegeoff> there's no certification process like sony and microsoft
[04:12] <darksydegeoff> also pc sales numbers are almost always a fraction of console sales
[04:12] <darksydegeoff> switch carts cost an arm and a leg for the publishers haha
[04:12] <darksydegeoff> but this is digital so
[04:12] <darksydegeoff> i'd be happy paying $20 for a game of this quality though
[04:13] <shinomei> Yeah I hate that about nintendo charging more for the cartridges. At least from what I've seen digital isn't touched.
[04:13] <darksydegeoff> yeah anything cart based is a shitton more than dvds
[04:14] <shinomei> Yeah Emerald 5 Course is considered the hardest at least in my book xD
[04:14] <darksydegeoff> yeah
[04:15] <@actfast231> Press Garden Kreygasm
[04:15] <shinomei> Ah really maybe I haven't seen that on other games. I mostly have their Triple A Games like Zelda and Splatoon 2
[04:15] <darksydegeoff> yeah i think it would be a good move by nintendo
[04:15] <shinomei> Only digital I have is Sonic Mania and Fast RMX
[04:15] <darksydegeoff> i personally don't like trophies/achievements because it cheapens the experience for me but
[04:15] <darksydegeoff> for 99% of people out there they love it
[04:16] <darksydegeoff> i have a mental issue where i need to plan out my run
[04:16] <shinomei> If I love the game so much I don't mind going for the trophies.
[04:16] <darksydegeoff> persona 5 is a perfect example, i ignored trophies just because i wanted to enjoy the experience
[04:16] <shinomei> Unless it has ridiculous requirements
[04:16] <darksydegeoff> yeah, when we make achievements for games
[04:17] <darksydegeoff> or at least when i make it
[04:17] <darksydegeoff> i don't really give it much of a thought lol
[04:17] <shinomei> Persona 5 though Kreygasm
[04:17] <@actfast231> I beg to differ, I used a guide on my playthrough for Confidant levelling and dungeon puzzles. Still adored my time with it
[04:17] <onemanarmy0001> whats your current trophy level?
[04:18] <shinomei> Oh wait didn't you say you got all gold medals to Sonic Mania?
[04:18] <darksydegeoff> i noticed that without trophies i was really focused on the experience for BotW
[04:19] <darksydegeoff> but yeah i'm a minority, i just can't not have the thought in the back of my head
[04:19] <shinomei> It thought there was a trophy for that D:
[04:19] <darksydegeoff> ohya sucks lol
[04:19] <shinomei> Shovel Knight PogChamp
[04:19] <onemanarmy0001> resident evil 5 is pretty low
[04:19] <onemanarmy0001> :-(
[04:20] <darksydegeoff> mishima or whatever that moon guy was fucking sucked the worst
[04:20] <darksydegeoff> at least you didn't get her std
[04:21] <shinomei> Persona 5 Stream \ PogChamp /
[04:21] <darksydegeoff> you should start shit with the sonic speedrunners and get notoriety that way
[04:21] <shinomei> Yusuke's Confidant was interesting MingLee
[04:21] <darksydegeoff> that place is tender af
[04:22] <shinomei> Which romance did you go for in Persona 5?
[04:22] <darksydegeoff> oh yeah dude they are babies
[04:22] <shinomei> This Stage though Kreygasm
[04:23] <darksydegeoff> it's just people pretending to own strats and when others do it they demand commission or something
[04:23] <darksydegeoff> i don't know
[04:24] <shinomei> Demanding commission wtf?
[04:25] <darksydegeoff> lol

[04:52] <maximo_3> super peel out (up + jump)?
[04:52] <maximo_3> you can only use it on a no save file

[22:54] <notbutterfree_bird> I think you almost had that newer chain. Just needed 2 yellows and then set up the rest.
[22:54] <justdaid> was this added by the people who made the game or did SEGA add it afterwards?
[22:55] <notbutterfree_bird> Sega did indeed brand puyo puyo over as its own separate game.

[03:29] <kolossus330> i love the game

[03:29] <pr0scription> Because 10 was more focused on cinematics and story. Trying to be a movie more than a game
[03:30] <@jaystank> the story and characters were actually good in 10 OpieOP
[03:30] <kolossus330> none of the characters in 13 are relatable
[03:30] <kolossus330> they don't grab your emotions
[03:30] <pr0scription> 10 is bright. the characters actually develop and have story.
[03:30] <kolossus330> which is bad for a game that is solely focused on them

[03:34] <kolossus330> thoughts on 15?
[03:34] <pr0scription> The only reason I played 13 was because the only Xbox they had was FF13 edition.

[04:03] <pyropolio> Yeah, I think people enjoy the fragility of your livlihood in those types of game, which i can understand. but it also makes it shit if you die in an unfortunate way.

[04:48] <@jaystank> MingLee
[04:48] <@tronbonneart> Barely. It's part-time
[04:48] <pyropolio> I just enjoyed it for the story. Honestly I wouldnt have enjoyed it any less if it were a movie though. I wouldnt call it much of a game.
[04:49] <@tronbonneart> Japanese skill, bruh.
[04:49] <pyropolio> There were things you could do in the endgame that were kinda neat. but the battle system wasn't that fun.
[04:49] <zornstorm> I hate 15 more then 13.... I hate that they made an amazing world and then made you leave it for a linear story... pissed me off... so wierd... and then 100000000000000000 side quests
[04:49] <zornstorm> what game?
[04:49] <@tronbonneart> Oh! btw you getting Striker Pack Switch?

[04:51] <@actfast231> Man, I've been meaning to play through 13-3. I adore the concept of garbs
[04:51] <pyropolio> Yeah, I agree. The presentation wasn't good. but if you took the time to figure it out it was actually really good. It was rewarding to me to try to figure it all out. but it's definitely not for everyone.
[04:52] <@tronbonneart> I understand that.
[04:53] <zornstorm> xDDDDDDDDDDDD
[04:53] <@tronbonneart> Dude. it's 10 bucks.
[04:53] <@tronbonneart> lol.
[04:53] <zornstorm> Same here
[04:53] <@tronbonneart> BRUH. IT'S 10 BUCKS THEN BUY IT TWICE
[04:53] <pyropolio> To be fair, there was a ton about ff7 that I didn't understand at first either though. Like how "Sephiroth" that you follow at the beginning isn't really sephiroth at all, but in fact Jenova who took the form of sephiroth. And how Cloud is being guided to the reuinion at the crater by Jenova because he, too, was infused with bits of Jenova
[04:53] <zornstorm> I have like 400 video games here
[04:53] <pyropolio> And figuring that shit out was mindblowing
[04:53] <zornstorm> physical copies
[04:53] <pyropolio> But it wasn't essential tot he entirety of the story
[04:53] <pyropolio> So there's a difference there.

[19:42] <heavywolf88> Hi. I didn't like any of it, the characters, the story ( space aliens, really?), the battle mechanics were completly straight forward unlike 7 and 8 which are very customizatable. so on and so..
[19:42] <justdaid> heloooooo verybody
[19:42] <justdaid> 8 is probably my least favorite FF game only because I hate the draw mechanic co co much

[19:43] <@ehlea> btw
[19:44] <heavywolf88> I don't count the ragnarok because those were random enemies, but you got me on Jenova
[19:44] <@actfast231> FF7 is low-key sci fi

[19:44] <heavywolf88> It was 9's delivery I didn't like. Any content can be great if delivered right. I don't think 9 did

[23:48] <@brovirtue> But yes @DarksydeGeoff I agree with the start of that remark
[23:48] <justdaid> The problem, in my eyes, is that Twitch and Youtube, the companies, have perpetuated that these people are not famous when infact the second you have people paying attention to you... you have fame... regardless of how much one tries to deny it
[23:50] <push_r> I dont think AJ realizes he is famous
